However, it remains achallenge to load large amounts of therapeutics into macrophages withoutcompromising cell functions. This study reports a silica-based drug nanocapsuleapproach to solve this issue. The nanocapsule consists of a drug-silica complexfilling and a solid silica sheath, and it is designed to minimally release drugmolecules in the early hours of cell entry. While taken up by macrophages at highrates, the nanocapsules minimally affect cell migration in the first 6-12 h,buying time for macrophages to home to tumors and release drugs in situ. Inparticular, it is shown that doxorubicin (Dox) as a representative drug can beloaded into macrophages up to 16.6 pg per cell using this approach. When testedin a U87MG xenograft model, intravenously (i.v.) injected Dox-laden macrophagesshow comparable tumor accumulation as untreated macrophages. Therapy leads toefficient tumor growth suppression, while causing little systematic toxicity.This study suggests a new cell platform for selective drug delivery, which can bereadily extended to the treatment of other types of diseases.^© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Relatively littleis known about how parenting concerns may differ among patients by cancer stage.METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of 203 adults with cancer who hadchildren < 18 years old from two geographically distinct areas. We used ananalysis of covariance to estimate the mean differences in PCQ, depressionsymptom severity and anxiety symptom severity (Hospital Anxiety and DepressionScale, HADS) scores between participants with metastatic and non-metastaticdisease, and Pearson's correlation coefficients to assess associations betweenHADS and PCQ scores by cancer stage.RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants (n = 146) had metastatic solid tumorcancer. In adjusted analyses, mean PCQ scores did not significantly differbetween parents with metastatic and non-metastatic disease (2.0 vs. 2.2,p = 0.06). Differences in mean PCQ scores were driven by a single questionconcerning the impact of death on children (2.3 vs. 2.9, p = 0.004). Mean HADSscores did not significantly differ between groups, although PCQ scores explaineda greater amount of variance in HADS scores for the metastatic group as comparedto the non-metastatic group.CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of concerns about death, intensity of parentingconcerns, as measured by the PCQ, was similar between parents with metastatic andnon-metastatic cancer. However, parenting concerns may be more strongly linked tooverall psychological distress in patients with metastatic disease. Furtherresearch is needed to clarify how parenting concerns uniquely relate to advancedstage illness.

Maintenance treatment with 16 mg/m2 BNC105P treatment continued for amaximum of six additional cycles. Patients were followed for safety andanti-tumor activity.RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were mostcommonly of hematological origin. Dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia andneutropenia) occurred in two patients at the dose level of 800 mg/m2 gemcitabine,carboplatin AUC4 and 16 mg/m2 BNC105P. No dose-limiting toxicities were observedat a dose level of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC4 and BNC105P 12 mg/m2.BNC105P as a single agent was well tolerated at a dose of 16 mg/m2 in maintenancetreatment. Ten patients (67%) achieved a complete or partial response accordingto CA125 and/or RECIST response criteria, four of 13 (31%) responded by RECISTalone. The median progression-free survival was 5.9 months.CONCLUSIONS: We have established that BNC105P 12 mg/m2 with gemcitabine1000 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC4 is the recommended dose level and has anacceptable toxicity profile. Further exploration of BNC105P in the ovarian cancersetting is planned.

However,while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures ofprogression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset ofERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remainunclear.METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) orcontrol diet + SDG (SDG, 100 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopicallyinjected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growthwas monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-κB signaling in SDG'santi-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDGmetabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studiesutilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model thetriple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively.RESULTS: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume andexpression of phospho-p65 and NF-κB target genes (P < 0.05). Markers ofmacrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad ofmice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P < 0.05). In vitro, ENLtreatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-κB activity and target geneexpression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression ofRela attenuated ENL's inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival.CONCLUSIONS: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via amechanism involving inhibition of NF-κB activity. SDG could serve as a practicaland effective adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence, but greater understandingof its effects is needed to inform the development of more targetedrecommendations for its use.

To improve communication resources for providers, wesought to characterize HPV vaccination messages available in existing educationalmaterials. In fall 2016, we searched PubMed, educational material clearinghouses,and Google for English language HPV vaccination messages. We extracted messagesthat a provider might use when raising the topic of HPV vaccination, answeringcommon questions, and motivating vaccination. Two reviewers independently codedeach message. The search identified 267 unique messages about HPV vaccination.Messages generally were long (mean no. of words = 44, standard deviation[SD] = 33) and required a high level of education to read (mean reading gradelevel = 10, SD = 3). Only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% hada readability at or below grade 6. Most frequent were messages to address commonparent questions or concerns (62%); the most common topics were diseasesprevented by HPV vaccine (18%) and safety and side effects (16%). Many messagesincluded information about cancer prevention (26%) and same-day vaccination(13%). Few messages (6%) used a presumptive style to recommend HPV vaccination.In conclusion, available messages about HPV vaccination were markedly varied. Weidentified few messages that were both brief (to facilitate providers memorizingthem) and accessible (to facilitate parents understanding them). Future researchshould identify which messages lead to HPV vaccine uptake.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, of the cancer patients who live in the world's poorestcountries less that 5% have access to safe, effective and timely cancer surgery.We designed a novel, competency-based curriculum to rapidly build surgicalcapacity for the treatment of cervical cancer. Here we report experiences andearly outcomes of its implementation in Malawi.Methods: Curriculum implementation consisted of preoperative evaluation ofpatients and surgical video review, discussion of surgical instruments and suturematerial, deconstruction of the surgical procedure into critical subcomponentsincluding trainees walking through the steps of the procedure with the mastertrainers, high-volume surgical repetition over a short time interval,intra-operative mentoring, post-operative case review, and mental narration. Thiswas preceded by self-directed learning and followed by clinical mentorshipthrough electronic communication and quarterly on-site visits.Results: Between June 2015-June 2017, 28 patients underwent radical abdominalhysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The first 8 surgeries wereperformed over 5 days. After the 7th case the trainee could perform the procedurealone. During and between quarterly mentoring-visits the trainee independentlyperformed the procedure on 20 additional patients. Major surgical complicationswere rare.Conclusions: Life-saving surgical treatment for cervical cancer is now availablefor the first time, as a routine clinical service, in Central/Northern, Malawi.

Murdock Research Institute, Kannapolis, NC28081, USA.(2)NIH Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core, Department ofNutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Nutrition ResearchInstitute, Kannapolis, NC 28081, USA.^Purpose: To conduct an exploratory study to identify mechanisms thatdifferentiate Luminal A (BT474 and MCF-7) and triple-negative (MDA-MB-231 andMDA-MB-468) breast cancer (BCa) cell lines to potentially provide noveltherapeutic targets based on differences in energy utilization.Methods: Cells were cultured in media containing either [U-13C]-glucose or[U-13C]-glutamine for 48 hours. Conditioned media and cellular extracts wereanalyzed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.Results: MCF-7 cells consumed the most glucose, producing the most lactate,demonstrating the greatest Warburg effect-associated energy utilization. BT474cells had the highest tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity. The majority ofenergy utilization patterns in MCF-7 cells were more similar to MDA-MB-468 cells,while the patterns for BT474 cells were more similar to MDA-MB-231 cells.Compared to the Luminal A cell lines, TNBC cell lines consumed more glutamine andless glucose. BT474 and MDA-MB-468 cells produced high amounts of 13C-glycinefrom media [U-13C]-glucose which was integrated into glutathione, indicating denovo synthesis.Conclusions: Stable isotopic resolved metabolomics using 13C substrates providedmechanistic information about energy utilization that was difficult to interpretusing 1H data alone. Overall, cell lines that have different hormone receptorstatus have different energy utilization requirements, even if they areclassified by the same clinical BCa subtype; and these differences offer cluesabout optimizing treatment strategies.

We aimed to assess the trends in utilization ofsurgical treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the United States,stratified by age groups.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Institute'sSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry for the period2004-2014. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with EAC were eligible forinclusion. The yearly incidence of esophagectomy, stratified by age groups(18-49, 50-70, and >70 years old), was calculated using Poisson regression.Weighted log-binomial regression was used to compare the proportion of patientsundergoing esophagectomy, within each age group. Inverse probability of treatmentweights were used to account for potential confounders.RESULTS: A total of 21,301 patients were included. During the study period, therate of esophagectomy decreased from 34.1% to 28.2% (P = .40) in patients between18 and 49 years old, from 38.6% to 33.3% (P = .06) in patients between 50 and 70years old, and from 21.4% to 16.9% (P = .04) in patients older than 70 years.After accounting for patient and cancer characteristics, patients older than 70years were 50% less likely to undergo esophagectomy compared with both patientsbetween 18 and 49 years old (risk ratio [RR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.45-0.57, P < .0001) and patients between 50 and 70 years old (RR 0.53, 95% CI0.50-0.56, P < .0001).CONCLUSION: Surgical resection is scarcely used in patients older than 70 yearsin the United States. Further investigation of surgical outcomes in elderlypatients is warranted to determine if surgical treatment is underutilized in alarge proportion of EAC patients.

We aim to assess if IPMN location is predictive ofharboring either high grade dysplasia (HGD) or invasive cancer (IC).METHODS: Patients undergoing resection for IPMN from seven institutions between2000 and 2015 (n = 275) were analyzed. HRS and WF were defined by the 2012Fukuoka international consensus guidelines.RESULTS: 168 (61%) patients had head/uncinate cysts, while 107 (39%) hadneck/body/tail cysts. No differences were noted between groups with regard toage, duct type, cyst size, or presence of at least one WF. Patients with cysts inthe head/uncinate were more often male (55% vs. 40%), had at least one HRS (24%vs. 11%), and more often harbored HGD or IC(49% vs. 27%)[all p < 0.05]. Onmultivariate analysis, only cyst location in the head/uncinate remainedassociated with presence of HGD or IC(odds ratio 4.76, p = 0.02).DISCUSSION: Cyst location is predictive of HGD or IC in patients with IPMNs.Head/uncinated cysts are more likely to harbor malignancy compared to those ofthe neck/body/tail.

We calculated IVC receipt bydisease risk, and among patients with low-intermediate risk disease, assessed therelationship between multi-level factors and IVC receipt using a logisticregression model with random intercepts for provider and service area, andpatient-, provider-, and service area-level fixed effects. We further assessedthe association of provider- and service area-level factors with IVC use byexamining intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).RESULTS: Similar proportions of low-intermediate (36%) and high-risk (34%)patients received IVC. In the multivariate analysis including low-intermediaterisk patients, service area volume was strongly and statistically significantlyassociated with IVC use (aOR, high- v. low-volume: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.58).Provider- and service area-level ICCs were large, (38%, p=0.0009 and 39% p=0.03,respectively) indicating that much of the variance in IVC use was explained byfactors at these levels.CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight opportunities to improve proficient use ofIVC.

Participants with financial toxicitywere more likely to report noncompliance with medication, owing to inability toafford prescription drugs (relative risk [RR], 3.55; 95% CI, 2.53 to 4.98), andreported forgoing mental health care (RR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.04 to 7.45), doctor'svisits (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.97 to 4.51), and medical tests (RR, 2.54; 95% CI,1.49 to 4.34). The most endorsed reasons for delayed care were not havinginsurance coverage and being unable to afford household expenses.CONCLUSION:: More than 25% of adults with cancer reported financial toxicity thatwas associated with an increased risk for medical noncompliance. Financialtoxicity remains a major issue in cancer care, and efforts are needed to ensurepatients experiencing high levels of financial toxicity are able to accessrecommended care.

TheBlessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test (BOMC) was administered prior tochemotherapy. Associations between baseline BOMC and functional (KarnofskySelf-Reported Performance Rating Scale (KPS), Time Up and Go Test (TUG), MedicalOutcomes Study (MOS) Physical Function, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living(IADL)), psychosocial (Mental Health Inventory-13, MOS Social Activity Limitationand Social Support Survey), medical, and socio-demographic variables wereassessed using linear regression analysis.RESULTS: In a sample of 331 women with breast cancer, the mean age was 65.2 yearsand 68.6% were 65 and older. Mean BOMC score was 3.60 on a scale from 0 (best) to28 (worst). After controlling for demographic factors, worse BOMC screening testresults were associated with KPS < 80 (p=0.01), IADL< 14 (p=0.02), TUG ≥ 14seconds (p=0.001), worse MOS Physical Function (p=0.0006), depressive symptoms(p=0.04), and social activity limitations (p=0.01).CONCLUSION: In a sample of women with breast cancer, pre-treatment cognitivescreening scores did not reveal profound cognitive impairment. BOMC screeningscores were associated with multiple measures of physical function, but furtherresearch is needed to determine a clinically meaningful cut point in the BOMC forscreening of cancer-related cognitive impairment.^This article is protected by copyright.

Abs were characterized usingimmunohistochemistry, Western blotting, cultures of murine cortical, andhippocampal neurons, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, knockout mice forTrim9 and 67, and cell-based assay. Control samples included sera from 63patients with small cell lung cancer without any paraneoplastic neurologicalsyndrome, 36 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and PNS, CSF from 100 patientswith autoimmune encephalitis, and CSF from 165 patients with neurodegenerativediseases. We found Abs targeting TRIM9 and TRIM67 at high concentration in theserum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a 78-year-old woman and a 65-year-oldman. Both developed subacute severe cerebellar ataxia. Brain magnetic resonanceimaging found no abnormality and no cerebellar atrophy. Both had CSF inflammationwith mild pleiocytosis and a few oligoclonal bands. We identified a pulmonaryadenocarcinoma, confirming the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome in bothpatients. They received immunomodulatory and cancer treatments withoutimprovement of cerebellar ataxia, even though both were in remission of theircancer (for more than 10 years in one patient). Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abswere specific to these two patients. All control serum and CSF samples testedwere negative for anti-TRIM9 and 67. Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs appeared tobe specific biomarkers of PCD and should be added to the panel of antigens testedwhen this is suspected.

Current adjuvant therapiesare unable to prevent progressive recurrences for a significant fraction ofpatients with breast cancer. Autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATCVs) are a safeand potentially useful strategy to prevent breast cancer recurrence, in apersonalized and patient-specific manner, following standard-of-care tumorresection. Given the high intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity in breastcancer, it is important to understand which factors influence the immunogenicityof breast tumor cells in order to maximize ATCV effectiveness.METHODS: The relative immunogenicity of two murine breast carcinomas, 4T1 andEMT6, were compared in a prophylactic vaccination-tumor challenge model.Differences in cell surface expression of antigen-presentation-related andcostimulatory molecules were compared along with immunosuppressive cytokineproduction. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to modulate tumor-derived cytokinesecretion. The impacts of cytokine deletion on splenomegaly, myeloid-derivedsuppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and ATCV immunogenicity were assessed.RESULTS: Mice vaccinated with an EMT6 vaccine exhibited significantly greaterprotective immunity than mice vaccinated with a 4T1 vaccine. Hybrid vaccinationstudies revealed that the 4T1 vaccination induced both local and systemic immuneimpairments. Although there were significant differences between EMT6 and 4T1 inthe expression of costimulatory molecules, major disparities in the secretion ofimmunosuppressive cytokines likely accounts for differences in immunogenicitybetween the cell lines. Ablation of one cytokine in particular,granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), reversed MDSC accumulation andsplenomegaly in the 4T1 model. Furthermore, G-CSF inhibition enhanced theimmunogenicity of a 4T1-based vaccine to the extent that all vaccinated micedeveloped complete protective immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer cells that express high levels of G-CSF have thepotential to diminish or abrogate the efficacy of breast cancer ATCVs.Fortunately, this study demonstrates that genetic ablation of immunosuppressivecytokines, such as G-CSF, can enhance the immunogenicity of breast cancercell-based vaccines. Strategies that combine inhibition of immunosuppressivefactors with immune stimulatory co-formulations already under development mayhelp ATCVs reach their full potential.

However, despite advantageous pharmacologic and formulation(e.g. long half-life, quicker time to onset, and lack of first-pass hepaticmetabolism) profiles, there seems to be significant risk of infusion-relatedhypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of intravenousrolapitant. In January 2018, the U.S. FDA issued a Health Care Provider Letterstating that anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, and other serious hypersensitivityreactions have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Importantly, thesereactions were observed at a higher rate than initially reported in the phase 1bioequivalence study that led to FDA approval of intravenous rolapitant (2.8%),with many resulting in hospitalizations. At our institution, rolapitant-inducedinfusion-related reactions also occurred in more patients than expected (8.7%).Described herein are six cases of infusion-related hypersensitivity reactionswith intravenous rolapitant at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital. Due to thequick onset of the infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions with intravenousrolapitant, interpatient differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics areunlikely to be the cause. An objective assessment utilizing the Naranjo CausalityScale rates these infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions as definite adversedrug reactions.

The aim of this paper is to propose a functional linear regressionmodel for using functional (or imaging) predictors to predict clinical outcomes(e.g., disease status), while addressing missing clinical outcomes. We introducean exponential tilting semiparametric model to account for the nonignorablemissing data mechanism. We develop a set of estimating equations and itsassociated computational methods for both parameter estimation and the selectionof the tuning parameters. We also propose a bootstrap resampling procedure forcarrying out statistical inference. Under some regularity conditions, wesystematically establish the asymptotic properties (e.g., consistency andconvergence rate) of the estimates calculated from the proposed estimatingequations. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are used to illustrate thefinite sample performance of the proposed methods.

This study aimed to define the association between DPYDvariants and fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity management costs. A cost analysiswas conducted on the toxicities experienced by 550 colorectal cancer patientstreated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Genotyping for DPYD*2A,DPYD*13, DPYDc.2846A>T, DPYD-HapB3, and UGT1A1*28 was done retrospectively, anddid not affect patients' treatments. Carriers of at least one DPYD variantexperienced higher toxicity management costs (2,972€, 95%CI 2,456-3,505) thannoncarriers (825€, 95%CI 785-864) (P<0.0001) and had a higher risk for toxicityrequiring hospitalization (OR=4.14, 95%CI 1.87-9.14). In patients receivingfluoropyrimidine/irinotecan, the incremental cost between DPYD variant andUGT1A1*28/*28 carriers and noncarriers was 2,975€. This study suggests that thetoxicity management costs during fluoropyrimidine-based therapy are associatedwith DPYD and UGT1A1*28 variants, and supports the utility of genotyping.

We describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broadclass of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidenceintervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembledand events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected onexplanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just forindividuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohortmembers enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design isthat this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of severaloutcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data mayallow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-responseanalyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive andothers multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due tointeraction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as wellas stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used toillustrate these methods.

Therefore, theextraction of cfDNA from a variety of clinical samples can be an effective andminimally invasive source of markers for disease detection and subsequentmanagement. In the oncological diseases, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a cfDNAsub-class, can carry clinically actionable mutations and coupled with nextgeneration sequencing or other mutation detection methods provide a venue foreffective in vitro diagnostics. However, cfDNA mutational analyses require highquality inputs. This necessitates extraction platforms that provide high recoveryover the entire ctDNA size range (50 → 150 bp) with minimal interferences (i.e.,co-extraction of genomic DNA), and high reproducibility with a simple workflow.Herein, we present a novel microfluidic solid-phase extraction device (μSPE)consisting of a plastic chip that is activated with UV/O3 to generatesurface-confined carboxylic acid functionalities for the μSPE of cfDNA. The μSPEuses an immobilization buffer (IB) consisting of polyethylene glycol and saltsthat induce cfDNA condensation onto the activated plastic microfluidic surface.The μSPE consists of an array of micropillars to increase extraction bed load(scalable to loads >700 ng of cfDNA) and can be produced at low-cost usingreplication-based techniques. The entire μSPE can be fabricated in a singlemolding step negating the need for adding additional extraction supports to thedevice simplifying production and keeping device and assay cost low. The μSPEallowed for recoveries >90% of model cfDNA fragments across a range of sizes(100-700 bp) and even the ability to extract efficiently short cfDNA fragments(50 bp, >70%). In addition, the composition of the IB allowed for reducing theinterference of co-extracted genomic DNA. We demonstrated the clinical utility ofthe μSPE by quantifying the levels of cfDNA in healthy donors and patients withnon-small-cell lung and colorectal cancers. μSPE extracted cfDNA from plasmasamples was also subjected to a ligase detection reaction (LDR) for determiningthe presence of mutations in the KRAS gene for colorectal and non-small cell lungcancer patients.

Statin adherence wasmeasured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the 2-year pre-cancerdiagnosis and the 2-year post-cancer diagnosis. Adherence patterns were assessedusing generalized estimating equations, for all cancers combined and stratifiedby cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and tumorcharacteristics.RESULTS: Among 10,177 cancer patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- topost-cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% confidence interval(95% CI):0.88-0.94). Statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancerdiagnosis among breast (ORadj:0.94, 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79,95% CI:0.74-0.85) cancer patients. No difference in adherence was observed amongprostate cancer patients (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97-1.05). Prior to cancerdiagnosis, adherence to statins was generally higher among non-Hispanic whitesand multi-race patients than other groups. However, statin adherence afterdiagnosis decreased only among these two populations (ORadj:0.85, 95%CI:0.85-0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76-0.97), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial variation in statin medication adherencefollowing diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large cohort ofprevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Improving our understanding of comorbiditymanagement and polypharmacy across diverse cancer patient populations iswarranted to develop tailored interventions that improve medication adherence andreduce disparities in health outcomes.

Many tumors aberrantly overexpress HORMAD1 yet the potential impactof this CT antigen on cancer biology is unclear. We tested a potential role ofHORMAD1 in genome maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We show that HORMAD1re-distributes to nuclear foci and co-localizes with the DSB marker γH2AX inresponse to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic agents. The HORMA domainand C-term disordered oligomerization motif are necessary for localization ofHORMAD1 to IR-induced foci (IRIF). HORMAD1-depleted cells are sensitive to IR andcamptothecin. In reporter assays, Homologous Recombination (HR)-mediated repairof targeted ISce1-induced DSBs is attenuated in HORMAD1-depleted cells. InNon-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) reporter assays, HORMAD1-depletion does notaffect repair of ISce1-induced DSB. Early DSB signaling events (including ATMphosphorylation and formation of γH2AX, 53BP1 and NBS1 foci) are intact inHORMAD1-depleted cells. However, generation of RPA-ssDNA foci and redistributionof RAD51 to DSB are compromised in HORMAD1-depleted cells, suggesting thatHORMAD1 promotes DSB resection. HORMAD1-mediated HR is a neomorphic activity thatis independent of its meiotic partners (including HORMAD2 and CCDC36.Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data show that similar to known HR pathway genesHORMAD1 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of HR genes isassociated with specific mutational profiles (including copy number variation).Taken together, we identify HORMAD1-dependent DSB repair as a new mechanism ofradioresistance and a probable determinant of mutability in lung adenocarcinoma.

The correlation between SFA andthe measured biomarkers were weak (r≤0.13, not significant). The ratio of VFA:SFAat L3/L4 was moderately correlated with VEGF-A (r=0.28, p=0.0008), and SAA(r=0.24, p=0.006), and less so with CRP (r=0.18, p=0.04) and sICAM-1 (r=0.18,p=0.04). Similar correlations were found for VFA:SFA ratio at L4/L5.CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association between visceral adiposity and biomarkersof inflammation and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer patients. In particular,the VFA:SFA ratio was correlated with circulating levels of pro-angiogenicbiomarker VEGF-A.IMPACT: Our findings support a direct association of visceral adipose tissue withinflammatory and angiogenic processes, which play fundamental roles in thedevelopment and progression of colorectal cancer.^Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.

[Epub ahead of print]^Adult physical activity and breast cancer risk in women with a family history ofbreast cancer.^Niehoff NM(1), Nichols HB(2), Zhao S(3), White AJ(4), Sandler DP(4).^Author information:(1)Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hillnicolen@live.unc.edu.(2)Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.(3)Biostatistics & Computational Biology Branch, National Institute ofEnvironmental Health Sciences.(4)Epidemiology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.^BACKGROUND: Recreational physical activity has been consistently associated withreduced breast cancer risk. Less is known about how family history of breastcancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister withbreast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported allrecreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered inassociation with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidenceintervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporatingcharacteristics of the family structure.RESULTS: During follow-up (average 8.4 years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higherhours/week (HR>=7vs<1=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) and MET-hours/week(HRquartile4vs1=0.75; 95%CI: 0.67-0.85) of physical activity were associated withreduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week wereassociated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk(MET-hours/week HRquartile4vs1=1.25; 95%CI: 0.98-1.60). Associations did not varywith extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal womenmay be limited to those with stronger family history.CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activitywas associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancerrisk and was not modified by extent of family history.IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physicalactivity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history ofbreast cancer.^Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.

Electronicaddress: segan@sickkids.ca.^CDH1 and PIK3CA are the two most frequently mutated genes in invasive lobularcarcinoma (ILC) of the breast. Transcription profiling has identified molecularsubtypes for ILC, one of which, immune-related (IR), is associated with geneexpression linked to lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Here, we report thatdeletion of Cdh1, together with activation of Pik3ca in mammary epithelium ofgenetically modified mice, leads to formation of IR-ILC-like tumors with immunecell infiltration, as well as gene expression linked to T-regulatory (Treg) cellsignaling and activation of targetable immune checkpoint pathways. Interestingly,these tumors show enhanced Rac1- and Yap-dependent transcription and signaling,as well as sensitivity to PI3K, Rac1, and Yap inhibitors in culture. Finally,high-dimensional immunophenotyping in control mouse mammary gland and IR-ILCtumors by mass cytometry shows dramatic alterations in myeloid and lymphoidpopulations associated with immune suppression and exhaustion, highlighting thepotential for therapeutic intervention via immune checkpoint regulators.^Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We aimed to evaluate the relationships between hormone andchemokine mediators of MPS function and the pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of PLDin obese and normal weight patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer.METHODS: Hormone and chemokine mediators in obese and normal weight ovarian andendometrial cancer patients were measured. A separate pharmacology study wasperformed that evaluated the relationship between serum hormone concentrations,MPS function, and PK disposition of PLD in refractory ovarian cancer patients.RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between serumestradiol and body mass index (OR 8.64, 95% CI 2.67-28.0, p < 0.001). Estrone andtestosterone concentrations were positively correlated with MPS function(ρ = 0.57 and 0.53, p = 0.14 and 0.18, respectively) and inversely correlatedwith PLD PK exposure (ρ = - 0.75 and - 0.76, respectively, p = 0.02 for both).CONCLUSIONS: Higher MPS function resulting in reduced PLD exposure is a potentialmechanism for reduced efficacy of PLD and other nanoparticles observed in obesepatients with cancer. PK simulations suggest higher doses of PLD are required inobese patients to achieve similar exposures as standard dosing in normal weightpatients.

Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinicalsettings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-riskadults.Data Extraction and Synthesis: At least 2 investigators independently extracteddata and appraised each study's risk of bias. Where sufficient data wereavailable, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled riskratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type ofintervention.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was completion of CRC screening.Examination included interventions to increase completion of (1) initial CRCscreening by any recommended modality, (2) colonoscopy after an abnormal initialscreening test result, and (3) continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests(FBTs).Results: The main review included 73 randomized clinical trials comprising366 766 patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that wereassociated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual careincluded FBT outreach (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.81-2.81; RD, 22%; 95% CI, 17%-27%),patient navigation (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.64-2.46; RD, 18%; 95% CI, 13%-23%),patient education (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36; RD, 4%; 95% CI, 1%-6%), patientreminders (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41; RD, 3%; 95% CI, 0%-5%), clinicianinterventions of academic detailing (RD, 10%; 95% CI, 3%-17%), and clinicianreminders (RD, 13%; 95% CI, 8%-19%). Combinations of interventions (clinicianinterventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greaterincreases than single components (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29; RD, 7%; 95% CI,3%-11%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increasedannual FBT completion (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.91-2.29; RD, 39%; 95% CI, 29%-49%).Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after aninitial abnormal screening test result (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.60; RD, 14%; 95%CI, 0%-29%).Conclusions and Relevance: Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation,particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated withincreased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should beincorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed oninterventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormalinitial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementationbarriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation.

Inthis systematic review, we aimed to (1) summarise the available prevalence dataon traditional medicine use by cancer patients in less developed countries(LDCs), and (2) stratify the prevalence data by world region and country incomelevel. A literature search for cancer, TCAM, and low income (LI) and lower-middleincome (LMI) countries was conducted across 5 databases. A total of 2,365publications were reviewed for eligibility, of which 25 studies met inclusioncriteria. The combined sample size was 6,878 cancer patients, with a median of54.5% reporting the use of TCAM for cancer care. Of the studies providing data onthe concomitant use of TCAM and conventional cancer treatment (n = 4,872 cancerpatients), a median of 26.7% of participants reported combining the two systemsof medicine. From the data available, it is apparent that TCAM use among cancerpatients in less developed countries is common; however, additional studies areneeded to support the safe and effective management of cancer for patients in LIand LMI countries.

All scans were reviewedby a dedicated neuroradiologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neckimaging. Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion to the genioglossus,hyoglossus, medial pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles was analyzed. Local andregional recurrence rates were compared between the muscle invasion and no muscleinvasion groups.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients met inclusion criteria with adequatefollow-up data and pretreatment imaging. Patients were predominantly male (87.5%male) and smokers (65.6% smokers) with a mean age of 56.7 (standard deviation:9.0 years). Most commonly invaded muscles in the muscle invasion group werehyoglossus (57.8%) and genioglossus (56.3%). There was no statisticallysignificant difference in primary site or nodal recurrence between the combinedgroup, including definite or possible muscle invasion and the group withoutmuscle invasion (P = 0.205 and P = 0.569, respectively). Additionally, nostatistically significant difference was present in recurrence-free anddisease-specific survival between the two groups at 3- and 5-year follow-up(P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion does not appear to be apredictor of human papilloma virus (+) OPSCC recurrence.

We aimed to estimate healthcare use and spending among gastrointestinal (GI) (including luminal, liver, andpancreatic) diseases in the United States.METHODS: We estimated health care use and spending based on the most currentlyavailable administrative claims from commercial and Medicare Supplemental plans,data from the GI Quality Improvement Consortium Registry, and national databases.RESULTS: In 2015, annual health care expenditures for gastrointestinal diseasestotaled $135.9 billion. Hepatitis ($23.3 billion), esophageal disorders ($18.1billion), biliary tract disease ($10.3 billion), abdominal pain ($10.2 billion),and inflammatory bowel disease ($7.2 billion) were the most expensive. Yearly,there were more than 54.4 million ambulatory visits with a primary diagnosis fora GI disease, 3.0 million hospital admissions, and 540,500 all-cause 30-dayreadmissions. There were 266,600 new cases of GI cancers diagnosed and 144,300cancer deaths. Each year, there were 97,700 deaths from non-malignant GIdiseases. An estimated 11.0 million colonoscopies, 6.1 million upper endoscopies,313,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies, 178,400 upper endoscopic ultrasoundexaminations, and 169,500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographyprocedures were performed annually. Among average-risk persons ages 50-75 yearswho underwent colonoscopy, 34.6% had 1 or more adenomatous polyps, 4.7% had 1 ormore advanced adenomatous polyps, and 5.7% had 1 or more serrated polyps removed.CONCLUSIONS: GI diseases contribute substantially to health care use in theUnited States. Total expenditures for GI diseases are $135.9 billion dollarsannually-greater than for other common diseases. Expenditures are likely tocontinue increasing.^Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Leveraging virtue of versatile abilitiesof Pd hydride nanomaterials in high/stable hydrogen storage, self-catalytichydrogenation, near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and photothermal conversion,here we utilize the cubic PdH0.2 nanocrystals for tumour-targeted andphotoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided hydrogenothermal therapy of cancer. Thesynthesized PdH0.2 nanocrystals have exhibited high intratumoural accumulationcapability, clear NIR-controlled hydrogen release behaviours, NIR-enhancedself-catalysis bio-reductivity, high NIR-photothermal effect and PAI performance.With these unique properties of PdH0.2 nanocrystals, synergetic hydrogenothermaltherapy with limited systematic toxicity has been achieved by tumour-targeteddelivery and PAI-guided NIR-controlled release of bio-reductive hydrogen as wellas generation of heat. This hydrogenothermal approach has presenteda cancer-selective strategy for synergistic cancer treatment.

Wedescribe finalized PTEN-specific variant classification criteria and outcomesfrom pilot testing of 42 variants with benign/likely benign (BEN/LBEN),pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PATH/LPATH), uncertain significance (VUS), andconflicting (CONF) ClinVar assertions. Utilizing these rules, classificationsconcordant with ClinVar assertions were achieved for 14/15 (93.3%) BEN/LBEN and16/16 (100%) PATH/LPATH ClinVar consensus variants for an overall concordance of96.8% (30/31). The variant where agreement was not reached was a synonymousvariant near a splice donor with noncanonical sequence for which in silico modelscannot predict the native site. Applying these rules to six VUS and five CONFvariants, adding shared internal laboratory data enabled one VUS to be classifiedas LBEN and two CONF variants to be as classified as PATH and LPATH. This studyhighlights the benefit of gene-specific criteria and the value of sharinginternal laboratory data for variant interpretation.

Germline pathogenicvariants in the CDH1 gene cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobularbreast cancer, a clinically challenging cancer predisposition syndrome that oftenrequires a multidisciplinary team of experts to be properly managed. Given thischallenge, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Hereditary Cancer Domainprioritized the development of the CDH1 variant curation expert panel (VCEP) todevelop and implement rules for CDH1 variant classifications. Here, we describethe CDH1 specifications of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, which were developed andvalidated after a systematic evaluation of variants obtained from a cohort ofclinical laboratory data encompassing ∼827,000 CDH1 sequenced alleles. Comparingpreviously reported germline variants that were classified using the 2015ACMG/AMP guidelines to the CDH1 VCEP recommendations resulted in reduced variantsof uncertain significance and facilitated resolution of variants with conflictedassertions in ClinVar.

The GSVS thenreviewed and analyzed available resources of relevant somatic data, and performedintegrative germline variant curation exercises. The committee determined thatsomatic hotspots could be systematically integrated into moderate evidence ofpathogenicity (PM1).

Cervicalcancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, butthere is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment,especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smearsfollowed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public healthfacilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches fortreating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) amongHIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at apublic HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis ofdata gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. Inthe trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN2+ and eligible for cryotherapy wererandomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN2+ at six months asdetermined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of theiroriginal treatment assignment-received LEEP. "Cure" was then defined as theabsence of disease at 12 months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Healthservice costs were estimated using micro-costing between June 2013 and April2014. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 3%. Two differentservice volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysiswere considered in sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: In total, 166 women with CIN2+ were enrolled (86 had LEEP; 80 hadcryotherapy). At 12 months, cumulative loss to follow-up was 12.8% (11/86) forthe LEEP group and 13.8% (11/80) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjustedintention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was nosignificant difference in efficacy. At 12 months, 83.8% (95% CI 73.8-91.1) ofwomen with CIN2+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN2+disease. In contrast, 76.7% (95% CI 66.4-85.2) of women assigned to LEEP werefree from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were lesscostly per patient randomized at US$ 118.00 (113.91-122.10), and per case "cured"at US$ 140.90 (136.01-145.79). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ 162.56(157.90-167.22) per patient randomized and US$ 205.59 (199.70-211.49) per casecured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was moreefficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant.Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity andscenario analyses.CONCLUSIONS: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treatapproach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and costoutcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months wasdominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment.However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacyresults were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity ofthe participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the "right"treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment andproviding careful monitoring of treatment outcomes.

Herein, we examine whether Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV), two onco-modulatory viruses, areassociated with HPV-mediated cervical neoplastic progression.METHODS OF STUDY: Sixty patient cervical brush samples from a study of NorthCarolina women were obtained. HPV RNA positivity was determined by Aptima testing(Hologic Corporation). The level of viral transcripts for EBV and CMV werequantified (RT-PCR analysis), and co-infection status with HPV was then comparedto the patient's cervical cytology grade.RESULTS: Over one third (38.3%) of the study population was CMV-positive, while43.3% was EBV-positive. When sample data were stratified by cytology grade, 36.5%(19/52) of normal patients, 75% (3/4) of low-grade squamous intraepitheliallesions (LSIL) and 100% (4/4) of patients with high-grade SIL (HSIL) were EBVpositive. Conversely, 35.2% (18/52) of normal patients, 25% (1/4) of patientswith LSIL and 50% (2/4) of patients with HSIL were CMV positive. When examiningonly HPV-positive associated HSIL,100% (4/4) were positive for both HPV and EBVdetection. This suggests co-viral detection with HPV and EBV is associated withmore advanced HSIL cervical lesions, while CMV displayed no clear associationwith higher grade of cervical cytology.CONCLUSIONS: Co-viral detection with EBV may increase the oncogenicity and/orserve as a viral marker of progression to HPV-associated high-grade cervicaldysplasia.

In addition toreplicating known signals at ABO, we identified a novel association of a commonloss-of-function, missense variant in FUT6 (rs17855739,p.Glu274Lys, p=9.02 x10-24) with higher soluble E-selectin levels. This variant is considerably morecommon in populations of African-ancestry compared to non-African ancestrypopulations. We replicated the association of FUT6 p.Glu274Lys with highersoluble E-selectin in an independent population of 748 AAs from the Women'sHealth Initiative and identified an additional pleiotropic association withvitamin B12 levels. Despite the broad role of both selectins andfucosyltransferases in various inflammatory, immune and cancer-related processes,we were unable to identify any additional disease associations of the FUT6p.Glu274Lys variant in an EMR-based phenome-wide association scan of over 9,000African Americans.

Extant literature has identified seven potential areas of investment toaddress SDoH: investments in sexual and reproductive health and family planning,early learning and child care, education, universal health care, as well asinvestments to reduce child poverty, ensure sustainable economic development, andcontrol health hazards. The aim of this paper is to produce a 'report card' onCanada's success in reducing socioeconomic and health inequities pertaining tothese seven policy domains, and to assess how Canadian trends compare to those inthe United Kingdom (UK), a country with a similar health and welfare system.Summarising evidence from published studies and national statistics, we foundthat Canada's best successes were in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in earlylearning and child care and reproductive health-specifically in improving equityin maternal employment and infant mortality. Comparative data suggest thatCanada's outcomes in the latter areas were like those in the UK. In contrast,Canada's least promising equity outcomes were in relation to health hazardcontrol (specifically, tobacco) and child poverty. Though Canada and the UKobserved similar inequities in smoking, Canada's slow upward trend in childpoverty prevalence is distinct from the UK's small but steady reduction of childpoverty. This divergence from the UK's trends indicates that alternativeinvestment types and levels may be needed in Canada to achieve similar outcomesto those in the UK.

We aimed to identify distinct lifestylepatterns based on five behavior/dietary exposures among a population-based sampleof women diagnosed with breast cancer, and to examine their association withsubsequent survival.METHODS: In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phases I/II, we interviewed 1,808women aged 20-74 following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. We determinedusing the National Death Index (717 deaths, 427 from breast cancer; medianfollow-up 13.56 years). We assessed lifestyle patterns using a latent classanalysis based on five behavioral and dietary exposures: current versusnever/former smokers; low versus high vegetable and fruit intake; high andlow/moderate, versus no alcohol consumption; and no and low/moderate, vs. highregular physical activity. We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjustedhazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality,and cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for breast cancer-specific mortalitywithin 5 years and 13 years post-diagnosis conditional on 5-year survival.RESULTS: We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: Healthy Behavior andDiet (n=916); Healthy Behavior and Unhealthy Diet (n=624); and Unhealthy Behaviorand Diet (n=268). The Unhealthy (vs. Healthy) Behavior and Diet pattern wasassociated with a 13-year conditional all-cause mortality HR of 1.4(95%CI=1.1-1.9) and with 13-year conditional breast cancer-specific andsubdistribution HRs of 1.2 (95%CI=0.79-1.9) and 1.2 (95%CI=0.77-1.8),respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestylepatterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis.

These indications were subsequently expanded to include larger,ulcerated, and predominantly undifferentiated mucosal lesions. In addition,differentiated type adenocarcinomas ≤ 3 cm with slight submucosal invasion of< 500 µm (pT1b1) are regarded as "curative" under the expanded criteria. However,data derived from studies of surgical specimens in patients with pT1b1 EGC haveyielded varying rates of lymph node metastasis (LNM).METHOD: A systemic review was conducted using the pooled analysis to calculatethe incidence of LNM in pT1b1 EGC, and to investigate whether using a cut-offvalue of < 300 µm would decrease the risk of LNM in patients with submucosal EGC.RESULTS: Nineteen articles were included. 1507 patients with pT1b1 EGC met theexpanded indications. The incidence of LNM was 3% (45 out of 1507 patients). In asubgroup analysis of three studies, there was no significant difference in theLNM between pT1b EGC < 300 µm and < 500 µm [3/121(2.5%) vs. 5/180 (2.8%)] (OR0.89, 95% CI 0.22-3.54).CONCLUSION: Overall, expanding the indications for endoscopic resection of EGC toinclude lesions ≤ 3 cm T1b1 is associated with a potential risk of LNM of 3%. Incountries outside of Japan, we found a slightly higher risk of LNM (4.0%). Theseestimates of LNM should be incorporated into decisions regarding furthermanagement of patients with EGC ≤ 3 cm who are found to have slight submucosalinvasion (< 500 µm) in an ESD specimen.

This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-inducedimpairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia2, whereas systemic effects oftumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood.Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD8+ T cellresponses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors.Specifically, we identify CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (CD71+TER119+; EPCs)as robust immunosuppressors. CD45+ EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associatedextramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a majorpopulation, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derivedsuppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD45+ EPC transcriptome closely resembles that ofMDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanismunderlying CD45+ EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressiveCD45+ EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. Thesefindings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likelycontributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients withadvanced cancer.

However, these findings have been inconsistent, appear to vary withpopulation characteristics, and may be specific for virulence factor VacA. Tomore thoroughly evaluate the potential association of H pylori antibodies withCRC risk, we assembled a large consortium of cohorts representing diversepopulations in the United States.METHODS: We used H pylori multiplex serologic assays to analyze serum samplesfrom 4063 incident cases of CRC, collected before diagnosis, and 4063 matchedindividuals without CRC (controls) from 10 prospective cohorts for antibodyresponses to 13 H pylori proteins, including virulence factors VacA and CagA. Theassociation of sero-positivity to H pylori proteins, as well as protein-specificantibody level, with odds of CRC was determined by conditional logisticregression.RESULTS: Overall 40% of controls and 41% of cases were H. pylori sero-positive(odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20). H pylori VacA-specificsero-positivity was associated with an 11% increased odds of CRC (OR, 1.11; 95%CI, 1.01-1.22), and this association was particularly strong among AfricanAmericans (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.95). Additionally, odds of CRC increased withlevel of VacA antibody in the overall cohort (P=.008) and specifically amongAfrican Americans (P=.007).CONCLUSION: In an analysis of a large consortium of cohorts representing diversepopulations, we found serologic responses to H pylori VacA to associate withincreased risk of CRC risk-particularly for African Americans. Future studiesshould seek to understand whether this marker is related to virulent H pyloristrains carried in these populations.^Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Inrecent years, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have emerged as promising systems forboth PDT and PCT. Their rich photochemical and photophysical properties derivefrom a variety of excited-state electronic configurations accessible with visibleand near-infrared light, and these properties can be exploited for both energy-and electron-transfer processes that can yield highly potent oxygen-dependentand/or oxygen-independent photobiological activity. Selected examples highlightthe use of rational design in coordination chemistry to control the lowest-energytriplet excited-state configurations for eliciting a particular type ofphotoreactivity for PDT and/or PCT effects. These principles are also discussedin the context of the development of TLD1433, the first Ru(II)-basedphotosensitizer for PDT to enter a human clinical trial. The design of TLD1433arose from a tumor-centered approach, as part of a complete PDT package thatincludes the light component and the protocol for treating non-muscle invasivebladder cancer. Briefly, this review summarizes the challenges to bringing PDTinto mainstream cancer therapy. It considers the chemical and photophysicalsolutions that transition metal complexes offer, and it puts into context themultidisciplinary effort needed to bring a new drug to clinical trial.

Palbociclib is an oral, selective inhibitor of CDK 4/6 that restores Rbfunction and promotes cell cycle arrest.METHODS: In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UCmolecularly selected for p16 loss and intact Rb by tumour immunohistochemistryreceived palbociclib 125 mg p.o. daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Primaryendpoint was progression-free survival at 4 months (PFS4) using a Simon'stwo-stage design. Next-generation sequencing including Rb pathway alterations wasconducted.RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled and two patients (17%) achieved PFS4 withinsufficient activity to advance to stage 2. No responses were seen. Median PFSwas 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8-3.7 months) and median overall survival was 6.3 months(95% CI 2.2-12.6 months). Fifty-eight percent of patients had grade ≥3hematologic toxicity. There were no CDKN2A alterations found and no correlationof Rb pathway alterations with clinical outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib did not demonstrate meaningful activity in selectedpatients with platinum-refractory metastatic UC. Further development ofpalbociclib should only be considered with improved integral biomarker selectionor in rational combination with other therapies.

This systematic scoping review examines the range and variety ofinterventions on the use of PS across the cancer care continuum.METHOD: We used a broad definition of PS to capture a wide-range of interventionsand characterize the current status of the field. Literature searches wereconducted using PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL to identify relevant articlespublished from January 2011 to June 2016. We screened the title and abstracts of2087 articles, followed by full-text screening of 420 articles, resulting in afinal sample of 242 articles of which the most recent 100 articles were reviewed(published June 2014 to May 2016).RESULTS: A number of the recent intervention studies focused on breast cancer(32%, breast cancer only) or multiple cancer sites (23%). Although theinterventions spanned all phases of the cancer care continuum, only 2% targetedend-of-life care. Seventy-six percent focused on clinical outcomes (e.g.,screening, treatment adherence) and 72% on reducing health disparities.Interventions were primarily phone-based (44%) or delivered in a clinic setting(44%). Only a few studies (22%) described the impact of providing PS on peersupporters.CONCLUSION: PS appears to be a widely used approach to address needs across thecancer care continuum, with many opportunities to expand its reach.

However, few studies to date have examinedwhether trajectories of CVD risk and major risk factors are worse among womenwith a breast cancer diagnosis compared with those without.METHODS: Changes in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic bloodpressure, and 10-year CVD risk were compared between women with (813 women) andwithout (1049 women) an incident breast cancer diagnosis while they were enrolledin the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study cohort.Blood pressure and adiposity measures were collected by trained examiners at anenrollment visit (≥1 year before breast cancer diagnosis) and a second home visit4 to 11 years later (≥1 year after breast cancer diagnosis). Thenon-laboratory-based Framingham risk score, a measure of 10-year general CVDrisk, was calculated at both the enrollment and second visits. All analyses werestratified by menopausal status at the time of enrollment.RESULTS: Women who were premenopausal at the time of enrollment experiencedmoderate increases in weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, andCVD risk over the study period. Those who were postmenopausal at the time ofenrollment demonstrated little change in weight, but were found to have increasesin waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and CVD risk. In both groups,changes over time did not differ significantly according to breast cancer status.Neither chemotherapy nor endocrine therapy were found to be associated withgreater increases in CVD risk or risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: In the current study cohort, changes over time in CVD risk,adiposity measures, and blood pressure were similar between women who developedan incident breast cancer and those who did not.^© 2018 American Cancer Society.

Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) disproportionately affects olderadults, yet to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined whethertreatment improves long-term survival. In the current study, the authorsevaluated the association between treatment of SBC and 10-year mortality inmedically complex older adults.METHODS: The authors identified 1800 older (aged ≥60 years) patients with SBC(American Joint Committee on Cancer stage ≤I) from 2 community-based healthsystems who received treatment (bladder instillation and/or transurethralresection) or observation. Cox proportional hazards regression was performedadjusting for age, sex, race, health system, stage of disease/grade, and MCC (≥2baseline chronic conditions). Propensity score analysis using stabilized inverseprobability of treatment weights was used to compare 10-year mortality in the 2treatment groups with adjustment for covariates.RESULTS: Overall, 1485 patients (82.5%) and 315 patients (17.5%) receivedtreatment and observation, respectively. In unweighted multivariable analysis,treatment was associated with a 30% reduction in death (adjusted hazard ratio[HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.58-0.85 [P<.01]) and MCC with a72% increase in death (adjusted HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.44-2.05 [P<.01]). Weightedanalysis with adjustment (doubly robust) also demonstrated a survival benefit fortreatment (adjusted HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.84 [P<.01]).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated a clinicallymeaningful association between cancer treatment and survival benefit in older,medically complex patients with SBC, even after adjustment for medicalcomplexity.

Women are high utilizers of healthcarewith gender-specific health issues that may benefit from the convenience andpersonalization of telehealth. Thus, we produced an evidence map describing thequantity, distribution, and characteristics of evidence assessing theeffectiveness of telehealth services designed for women.METHODS: We searched MEDLINE® (via PubMed®) and Embase® from inception throughMarch 20, 2018. We screened systematic reviews (SRs), randomized trials, andquasi-experimental studies using predetermined eligibility criteria. Articlesmeeting inclusion criteria were identified for data abstraction. To assessemerging trends, we also conducted a targeted search of ClinicalTrials.gov .RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four primary studies and three SRs were eligible forabstraction. We grouped studies into focused areas of research: maternal health(n = 96), prevention (n = 46), disease management (n = 63), family planning(n = 9), high-risk breast cancer assessment (n = 10), intimate partner violence(n = 7), and mental health (n = 3). Most interventions focused on phone as theprimary telehealth modality and featured healthcare team-to-patient communicationand were limited in duration (e.g., < 12 weeks). Few interventions were conductedwith older women (≥ 60 years) or in racially/ethnically diverse populations.There are few SRs in this area and limited evidence regarding newer telehealthmodalities such as mobile-based applications or short message service/texting.Targeted search of clinical.trials.gov yielded 73 ongoing studies that show ashift in the use of non-telephone modalities.DISCUSSION: Our systematic evidence map highlights gaps in the existingliterature, such as a lack of studies in key women's health areas (intimatepartner violence, mental health), and a dearth of relevant SRs. With few existingSRs in this literature, there is an opportunity for examining effects,efficiency, and acceptability across studies to inform efforts at implementingtelehealth for women.

There is a critical need to advanceunderstanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive CD heterogeneity.METHODS: We performed small RNA sequencing of adult colon tissue from CD and NIBDcontrols. Colonic epithelial cells and immune cells were isolated from colonictissues, and microRNA-31 (miR-31) expression was measured. miR-31 expression wasmeasured in colonoid cultures generated from controls and patients with CD. Weperformed small RNA-sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colon andileum biopsies from treatment-naive pediatric patients with CD and controls andcollected data on disease features and outcomes.RESULTS: Small RNA-sequencing and microRNA profiling in the colon revealed 2distinct molecular subtypes, each with different clinical associations. Notably,we found that miR-31 expression was a driver of these 2 subtypes and, further,that miR-31 expression was particularly pronounced in epithelial cells. Colonoidsrevealed that miR-31 expression differences are preserved in this ex vivo system.In adult patients, low colonic miR-31 expression levels at the time of surgerywere associated with worse disease outcome as measured by need for an endileostomy and recurrence of disease in the neoterminal ileum. In pediatricpatients, lower miR-31 expression at the time of diagnosis was associated withfuture development of fibrostenotic ileal CD requiring surgeryCONCLUSIONS.

Data were electronically captured based on orders processed through theoutpatient oncology setting, including hazardous and nonhazardous medications.Based on current workflow, inpatient and outpatient orders were reviewed inproductivity metrics. The metric defining the variability of the workload itselfwas weighted dispense type as it was the best representation of a mixed-skillworkflow. After conducting workflow process mapping, discrete measurable stepswere assessed and evaluated daily. Operational components of interest includedpharmacist verification activities and technician compounding activities.Historical production data were sampled for assigning relative value units (RVUs)respective to time to normalize workload into a common unit (i.e., 1 hour) and torelate work demand in a highly variable setting. RVUs were assigned anddelineated by cognitive and distributive activities for pharmacists andtechnicians, respectively. The Cleveland Clinic department of pharmacy developeda productivity tool to retrospectively measure workload involving time to review,verify, reconstitute, admix, and deliver chemotherapeutic agents. The weightingof each medication allowed for precise and meaningful evaluation of productivity.With RVUs assigned to 2 years of operational metrics, there now exists anopportunity to monitor performance trends within the cancer treatment centerpharmacy. The data are readily retrievable within the electronic health record.CONCLUSION: The productivity data provided precise information to assess trendsin operations within the pharmacy of an outpatient cancer treatment center.^Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

CIN2 treatment was abstracted from medical records.RESULTS: The majority of women were African American (53%), current smokers (53%)and had a median age of 33 years at CIN2 diagnosis. Among the 104 HIV-positivewomen, 62 (59.6%) did not receive CIN2 treatment. Twelve HIV-positive women(11.5%) showed CIN2 progression to CIN3; none were diagnosed with cervicalcancer. There was no difference in the median time to progression betweenCIN2-treated and -untreated HIV-positive women (2.9 vs. 2.7 years, p=0.41). CIN2treatment was not associated with CIN2 progression in multivariate analysis (aHR[adjusted hazard ratio] 1.82; 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.54, 7.11), adjustingfor combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and CD4+ T cell count. InHIV-positive women, each increase of 100 CD4+ T cells was associated with a 33%decrease in CIN2 progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88), adjusting for CIN2treatment and cART.CONCLUSIONS: CIN2 progression is uncommon in this population, regardless of CIN2treatment. Additional studies are needed to identify factors to differentiatewomen at highest risk of CIN2 progression.

To test the hypothesis that there are additionalcancer types with high prevalence of EBV, we determined EBV viral expression inall the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) samples (n= 10,396) from 32 different tumor types. We found that EBV was present in gastricadenocarcinoma and lymphoma, as expected, and was also present in >5% of samplesin 10 additional tumor types. For most samples, EBV transcript levels were low,which suggests that EBV was likely present due to infected infiltrating B cells.In order to determine if there was a difference in the B-cell populations, weassembled B-cell receptors for each sample and found B-cell receptor abundance (P≤ 1.4 × 10-20) and diversity (P ≤ 8.3 × 10-27) were significantly higher inEBV-positive samples. Moreover, diversity was independent of B-cell abundance,suggesting that the presence of EBV was associated with an increased and alteredB-cell population. IMPORTANCE Around 20% of human cancers are associated withviruses. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to gastric cancer, nasopharyngealcarcinoma, and certain lymphomas, but its role in other cancer types remainscontroversial. We assessed the prevalence of EBV in RNA-seq from 32 tumor typesin the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and found EBV to be present in >5% ofsamples in 12 tumor types. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells and in Bcells causes proliferation. We hypothesized that the low expression of EBV inmost of the tumor types was due to infiltration of B cells into the tumor. Theincrease in B-cell abundance and diversity in subjects where EBV was detected inthe tumors strengthens this hypothesis. Overall, we found that EBV was associatedwith an increased and altered immune response. This result is not evidence ofcausality, but a potential novel biomarker for tumor immune status.

Electronic address:greg_wang@med.unc.edu.^Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is crucial for prostate cancerprogression and therapeutic resistance. We show that, independent of ligand,AR-V7 binds both androgen-responsive elements (AREs) and non-canonical sitesdistinct from full-length AR (AR-FL) targets. Consequently, AR-V7 not onlyrecapitulates AR-FL's partial functions but also regulates an additional geneexpression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than AREenhancers. AR-V7 binding and AR-V7-mediated activation at these unique targets donot require FOXA1 but rely on ZFX and BRD4. Knockdown of ZFX or select uniquetargets of AR-V7/ZFX, or BRD4 inhibition, suppresses growth ofcastration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V7 direct targetgene signature that correlates with AR-V7 expression in primary tumors,differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poorprognosis. Thus, AR-V7 has both ARE/FOXA1 canonical and ZFX-directednon-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeuticresistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was toevaluate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MED) and DietaryApproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores and prostate canceraggressiveness by race.METHODS: Data from the population-based, case-only North Carolina-LouisianaProstate Cancer Project (PCaP) were used to examine the association between dietquality, measured by MED and DASH scores, and prostate cancer aggressiveness in1899 African American (AA) and European American (EA) research subjects. Dietaryintake was assessed using a modified National Cancer Institute Diet HistoryQuestionnaire. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for high versus low-intermediateaggressive prostate cancer.RESULTS: Higher MED scores were inversely associated with high aggressiveprostate cancer overall (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95 for high versus lowscores); results were similar for AA and EA men. A weaker inverse associationbetween DASH scores and prostate cancer aggressiveness was found (OR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.55, 1.06).CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality, as represented by a Mediterranean-style diet orDASH diet, may reduce the odds of high aggressive prostate cancer.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Because maleBC is rare, not much is known about the disease, and treatment recommendationsare typically extrapolated from data available from clinical trials enrollingfemale BC patients.METHODS: We review the epidemiology, risk factors, prognosis, and the variedmolecular and clinicopathologic features that characterize male BC. In addition,we summarize the available data for the use of systemic therapy in the treatmentof male BC and explore the ongoing development of targeted therapeutic agents forthe treatment of this subgroup of BCs.RESULTS: There are important biological differences between male and female BC.Male BC is almost exclusively hormone receptor positive (+), including theandrogen receptor (AR), and is associated with an increased prevalence of BRCA2germline mutations, especially in men with increased risk for developinghigh-risk BC. Additional research is warranted to better characterize male BC. Toaccomplish this, a multi-national consortium approach, such as the InternationalMale Breast Cancer Program, is needed in response to the scarcity of patients.This approach allows the pooling of information from a large number of men withBC and the creation of registries for future therapeutic-focused clinical trials.CONCLUSIONS: Given the unique biology of BC in men, promising new therapeutictargets are currently under investigation, including the use of poly-ADP-ribosepolymerase inhibitors or AR-targeted agents either as monotherapy or incombination with other agents.

However, whether race modifies theassociation between metformin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness remainsuncertain. The association between metformin use and prostate canceraggressiveness was examined separately in Black Americans (Blacks) and WhiteAmericans (Whites).METHODS: The study population consisted of 305 Black and 195 White researchparticipants with incident prostate cancer and self-reported diabetes from theNorth Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. High-aggressive prostate cancerwas defined using a composite measure of Gleason sum, prostate-specific antigen,and clinical stage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess theassociation between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer atdiagnosis, separately among Whites and Blacks, with adjustment for age, screeninghistory, site, education, insurance, and body mass index.RESULTS: Metformin use was associated positively with high-aggressive prostatecancer in Blacks (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.05, 3.83). By contrast, a weak inverseassociation between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer was foundin Whites (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34, 1.85).CONCLUSIONS: The association between metformin use and prostate canceraggressiveness may be modified by race.

However, in cells with 53BP1 gene knockout (KO), BRCA1 isdispensable for the initiation of resection, but whether BRCA1 activity isentirely redundant after end resection is unclear. Here, we found that 53bp1 KOrescued the embryonic viability of a Brca1ΔC/ΔC mouse model that harbors a stopcodon in the coiled-coil domain. However, Brca1ΔC/ΔC;53bp1-/- mice weresusceptible to tumor formation, lacked Rad51 foci, and were sensitive to PARPinhibitor (PARPi) treatment, indicative of suboptimal HR. Furthermore, BRCA1mutant cancer cell lines were dependent on truncated BRCA1 proteins that retainedthe ability to interact with PALB2 for 53BP1 KO induced RAD51 foci and PARPiresistance. Our data suggest that the overall efficiency of 53BP1 loss offunction induced HR may be BRCA1 mutation dependent. In the setting of 53BP1 KO,hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins are active downstream of end resection, promotingRAD51 loading and PARPi resistance.^Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study aims to characterize rates of HCM in a closelymonitored subpopulation-postpartum women with IBD-and identify predictors ofnoncompliance.Methods: A national prospective pregnancy registry was utilized to collectcompletion rates of HCM recommendations (cervical cancer screening; osteoporosisscreening; pneumococcal, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines).Completion of a recommendation at least once during follow-up was sufficient,except for influenza vaccine, which was assessed yearly. Patients were classifiedby drug exposures: immunomodulator (Group A), biologic (Group B), combinationtherapy (Group AB), and unexposed. Confounders assessed were steroid exposure,IBD flare, IBD care site, primary care provider (PCP) access, marital status,income, education level, and race.Results: There were 628 postpartum IBD women with at least 1 year of follow-up.HCM rates were as follows: cervical cancer screening (84%), osteoporosisscreening (54%), pneumococcal (50%), hepatitis A (61%), hepatitis B (81%), andinfluenza (72%) vaccines. The unexposed group demonstrated lower pneumococcalvaccination rates than groups A, B, and AB. Group B demonstrated lower cervicalcancer screening rates than the unexposed. PCP access and low education predictedhepatitis vaccine noncompliance. Unmarried status and low income predictedcervical cancer screening noncompliance. Low income predicted influenza vaccinenoncompliance.Conclusions: Postpartum women have multiple providers, yet they complete HCM atsuboptimal rates. Risk factors include biologic exposure, unmarried status, lowincome, low education, and access to a PCP. Awareness among providers andpatients is important and needs to be enhanced.

Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with adiverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There issubstantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance insolid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutictarget. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-richC-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminaltail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We foundthat TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinaseinhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinasedomains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Usinga thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the PublishedKinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classifycompounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signalingand survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development ofTRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling thecellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that smallmolecule-induced protein down-regulation through drug "off-targets" might berelevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.^Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.

Lund)Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC (HannaSanoff).^BACKGROUND: Methods developed to estimate intervention effects in external targetpopulations assume that all important effect measure modifiers have beenidentified and appropriately modeled. Propensity score-based diagnostics can beused to assess the plausibility of these assumptions for weighting methods.METHODS: We demonstrate the use of these diagnostics when assessing thetransportability of treatment effects from the standard of care for metastaticcolorectal cancer control arm in a phase III trial (HORIZON III) to a targetpopulation of 1,942 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years.RESULTS: In an unadjusted comparison, control arm participants had lowermortality compared with target population patients treated with the standard ofcare therapy [trial vs. target hazard ratio (HR)= 0.72, 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.58, 0.89]. Applying inverse odds of sampling weights attenuated the trialvs. target HR (weighted HR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.26). However, whether unadjustedor weighted, hazards did not appear proportional. At 6 months of follow-up,mortality was lower in the weighted trial population than the target population(weighted trial vs. target risk difference (RD) = -0.07, 95% CI -0.13, -0.01),but not at 12 months (weighted RD= 0.00, 95% CI: -0.09, 0.09).CONCLUSION: These diagnostics suggest direct transport of treatment effects fromHORIZON III to the Medicare population is not valid. However, the proposedsampling model might allow valid transport of the treatment effects onlonger-term mortality from HORIZON III to the Medicare population treated inclinical practice.

China.(3)Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics The University of North Carolina atCharlotte 9201, University City Blvd Charlotte NC 28223 USA.^Identification of a few cancer driver mutation genes from a much larger number ofpassenger mutation genes in cancer samples remains a highly challenging task.Here, a novel method for distinguishing the driver genes from the passenger genesby effective integration of somatic mutation data and molecular interaction datausing a maximal mutational impact function (MaxMIF) is presented. When evaluatedon six somatic mutation datasets of Pan-Cancer and 19 datasets of differentcancer types from TCGA, MaxMIF almost always significantly outperforms all theexisting state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity,and specificity. It recovers about 30% more known cancer genes in 500 top-rankedcandidate genes than the best among the other tools evaluated. MaxMIF is alsohighly robust to data perturbation. Intriguingly, MaxMIF is able to identifypotential cancer driver genes, with strong experimental data support. Therefore,MaxMIF can be very useful for identifying or prioritizing cancer driver genes inthe increasing number of available cancer genomic data.

Questionnaires were sent to 1794patients. Phone calls were made to nonrespondents. The authors described type ofDS use before, during, and after initial cancer treatment, source of advice on DSuse, and used logistic regression to investigate the association of DS use duringor after cancer treatment with clinical/sociodemographic characteristics andsource of advice.RESULTS: Six hundred and three (34%) patients completed the questionnaires.Nonvitamin nonmineral DS use during initial cancer treatments was common: anycancer treatment (49%), chemotherapy (52%), and radiation therapy (51%). Amongpatients seeking advice on DS use, 75% reported professional sources, 44%reported media sources, and 47% reported lay sources. DS use during cancertreatment was strongly predicted by prior DS use, followed by prior complementarytherapies' use, receiving DS advice from a cancer care provider, being female,and higher education level.CONCLUSION: DS use is common and persists during cancer treatment. Among DS usersduring treatment, 18% used an herbal supplement, which are likely to carrygreater risk of interaction with chemotherapy agents compared with vitamin,mineral, and other supplements. Although many respondents sought DS advice fromprofessional sources, the use of nonprofessional sources remains high.

Electronicaddress: dydszyzf@163.com.^Chemo-immunotherapy represents an appealing approach to improving cancertreatment. Simultaneously administrating chemotherapeutics with immunoadjuvantscan elicit potent tumor death and immune responses. Herein, high densitylipoprotein (HDL) inspired immune lipoprotein was proposed for relay drugdelivery and amplifying antitumor therapy. Lipophilic AS1411aptamer-immunoadjuvant CpG fused sequences (Apt-CpG-DSPE) were conjugated tofacilitate decoration onto HDLs; and doxorubicin (Dox) was successivelyintercalated into the consecutive base pairs of Apt-CpG to complete immune HDLnanodrug imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox. For relay drug delivery, imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox underwentsite-specific structure collapse in tumor intercellular substances inspired fromHDL biofunctions (sequential module I); subsequently, dissociated Apt-CpG-Dox wasendocytosed into tumor cells mediated by the recognition of AS1411 and nucleolin(sequential module II), translocating Dox to nucleus and enabling tumor ablationand antigens release. The liberated CpG motif further evoked antigen recognition,induced vast secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated hostantitumor immunity. Our studies demonstrated that HDL biomimetic platform basedrelay drug delivery strategy outperformed the monotherapy counterparts inmalignant tumor models, eventually generating an augmented antitumor efficacy.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

All positive blood cultures from RCWMCHoncology patients taken in 2012 to 2014 were retrieved to identify BSI cases.RESULTS: From 343 positive cultures, 150 BSI episodes were identified amongst 89patients; 49.1% of the culture isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 41.6% weregram-negative bacteria and 9.3% fungal. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus andViridans Group Streptococcus were the commonest gram-positive isolates.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the commonest gram-negativeisolates. The majority of BSI episodes occurred in patients with haematologicalmalignancies (74%), in the presence of severe neutropaenia (76.4%) and wasassociated with chemotherapy (88%). Complications occurred in 14% of BSI. Fungalinfections had the highest prevalence of complications (21.4%). Three childrendied during BSI giving a case-fatality rate of 2%.CONCLUSION: BSI in our patients are mainly caused by gram-positive bacteria andassociated with a low case-fatality rate. These results are consistent withworldwide experience of BSI in paediatric oncology.^Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of NorthCarolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill.^Importance: Localized prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment among elderly menwho are not likely to benefit represents a potential source of low-value healthcare services.Objective: To quantify the costs to the Medicare program associated withdetection and treatment of prostate cancer among elderly men in the UnitedStates.Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide, population-based,retrospective cohort study uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify men 70 years or older diagnosed withlocalized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2007 and to ascertain Medicare costsassociated with diagnosis and workup, treatment, follow-up, and morbiditymanagement of the disease. National Medicare costs were estimated usingper-person costs, stage-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates by age from SEER2007 through 2011, and 2010 Census population estimates by age.Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated costs to the Medicare program overall, andin each (mutually exclusive) category related to diagnosis and workup, treatment,follow-up, and morbidity management.Results: This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study included49 692 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the SEER-Medicare database(all participants were 70 years or older; 25 981 [52.3%] were 76 years or older).The median per-patient cost within 3 years after prostate cancer diagnosis was$14 453 (interquartile range [IQR], $4887-$27 899). The majority of this cost wasattributable to treatment costs (median, $10 558; IQR, $1990-$23 718). Patientswith a Gleason score of 6 or lower who pursued initial conservative management(no treatment within 12 months of diagnosis) had a 3-year median total cost of$1914 per patient. The estimated total 3-year cost to the Medicare programassociated with the annual detection of prostate cancer in men 70 years or olderis approximately $1.2 billion. Increasing active surveillance use in those withGleason score of 6 or lower could reduce this cost by $320 million.Conclusions and Relevance: There is substantial cost to the Medicare programassociated with the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer amongelderly men in the United States, despite the fact that these men are unlikely todie of prostate cancer. The majority of costs are related to treatment. Reducingprovision of low-value health care services among this patient population couldresult in significant health care savings.

Iqbal Parker, University of Cape Town,Cape Town, South Africa.^Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide and the sixth mostcommon cause of cancer-related death; however, worldwide incidence and mortalityrates do not reflect the geographic variations in the occurrence of this disease.In recent years, increased attention has been focused on the high incidence ofesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) throughout the eastern corridor ofAfrica, extending from Ethiopia to South Africa. Nascent investigations areunderway at a number of sites throughout the region in an effort to improve ourunderstanding of the etiology behind the high incidence of ESCC in this region.In 2017, these sites established the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium. Here,we summarize the priorities of this newly established consortium: to implementcoordinated multisite investigations into etiology and identify targets forprimary prevention; to address the impact of the clinical burden of ESCC viacapacity building and shared resources in treatment and palliative care; and toheighten awareness of ESCC among physicians, at-risk populations, policy makers,and funding agencies.

Park, Brigham and Women'sHospital; Jean Claude Mugunga, Partners In Health, Boston, MA; and Lawrence N.Shulman, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.^PURPOSE: The cost of providing cancer care in low-income countries remainslargely unknown, which creates a significant barrier to effective planning andresource allocation. This study examines the cost of providing comprehensivecancer care at the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE) in Rwanda.METHODS: A retrospective costing analysis was conducted from the providerperspective by using secondary data from the administrative systems of the BCCOE.We identified the start-up funds necessary to begin initial implementation anddetermined the fiscal year 2013-2014 operating cost of the cancer program,including capital expenditures and fixed and variable costs.RESULTS: A total of $556,105 US dollars was assessed as necessary start-upfunding to implement the program. The annual operating cost of the cancer programwas found to be $957,203 US dollars. Radiotherapy, labor, and chemotherapy werethe most significant cost drivers. Radiotherapy services, which require sendingpatients out of country because there are no radiation units in Rwanda, comprised25% of program costs, labor accounted for 21%, and chemotherapy, supportivemedications, and consumables accounted for 15%. Overhead, training, computedtomography scans, surgeries, blood products, pathology, and social servicesaccounted for less than 10% of the total.CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to examine operating costs forimplementing a cancer center in a low-income country. Having a strong commitmentto cancer care, adapting clinical protocols to the local setting, shifting tasks,and creating collaborative partnerships make it possible for BCCOE to providequality cancer care at a fraction of the cost seen in middle- and high-incomecountries, which has saved many lives and improved survival. Not all therapies,though, were available because of limited financial resources.

Othieno-Abinya, Universityof Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.^PURPOSE: In response to the increasing cancer burden in Kenya, this studyidentified barriers to patients seeking access to cancer testing and treatmentand to clinicians in delivering these services. Policy recommendations based onfindings are presented.METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured key informant interviews.Purposive sampling was used to recruit 14 participants: seven oncology cliniciansand seven support and advocacy leaders for patients with cancer. Qualitativeanalysis was used to identify themes.RESULTS: Seven barriers to cancer testing and treatment were identified: highcost of testing and treatment, low level of knowledge about cancer amongpopulation and clinicians, poor health-seeking behaviors among population, longdistances to access diagnostic and treatment services, lack of decentralizeddiagnostic and treatment facilities, poor communication, and lack of bettercancer policy development and implementation.CONCLUSION: Kenyans seeking cancer services face significant barriers that resultin late presentation, misdiagnosis, interrupted treatment, stigma, and fear. Fourpolicy recommendations to improve access for patients with cancer are (1) improvehealth insurance for patients with cancer; (2) establish testing and treatmentfacilities in all counties; (3) acquire diagnosis and treatment equipment andtrain health personnel to screen, diagnose, and treat cancer; and (4) increasepublic health awareness and education about cancer to improve diagnoses andtreatment. Effective cancer testing and treatment options can be developed toaddress cancer in a resource-constrained environment like Kenya. An in-depth lookat effective interventions and policies being implemented in countries facingsimilar challenges would provide valuable lessons to Kenya's health sector andpolicymakers.

By leveraging the successes and experiences of theCCPPZ, we intended to build capacity for the early detection and surgicaltreatment of breast cancer.METHODS: Our initiative sought to build capacity for breast cancer care throughthe (1) formation of a breast cancer advocacy alliance to raise awareness, (2)creation of resource-appropriate breast cancer care training curricula for mid-and high-level providers, and (3) implementation of early detection and treatmentcapacity within two major health care facilities.RESULTS: Six months after the completion of the initiative, the followingoutcomes were documented: Breast health education and clinical breast examination(CBE) services were successfully integrated into the service platforms of fourCCPPZ clinics. Two new breast diagnostic centers were opened, which providedaccess to breast ultrasound, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and needleaspiration. Breast health education and CBE were provided to 1,955 clients, 167of whom were evaluated at the two diagnostic centers; 55 of those evaluatedunderwent core-needle biopsy, of which 17 were diagnosed with invasive cancer.Newly trained surgeons performed six sentinel lymph node mappings, eight sentinellymph node dissections, and 10 breast conservation surgeries (lumpectomies).CONCLUSION: This initiative successfully established clinical services in Zambiathat are critical for the early detection and surgical management of breastcancer.

The immediate goal was to improve existing gliomaclassification methods through creation of a histologic atlas of features, thusyielding greater harmonization of phenotypic characterization. The long-term goalwas to support future incorporation of clinical outcomes and genomic data intoproposed simplified diagnostic schema, so as to further bridge the worlds ofveterinary and physician neuropathology and strengthen validity of the dog as anaturally occurring, translationally relevant animal model of human glioma. Allcases were morphologically reclassified according to a new schema devised by theentire board, yielding a majority opinion diagnosis of astrocytoma (43, 22.3%),19 of which were low-grade and 24 high-grade, and oligodendroglioma (134, 69.4%),35 of which were low-grade and 99 were high-grade. Sixteen cases (8.3%) could notbe classified as oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma based on morphology alone andwere designated as undefined gliomas. The simplified classification schemeproposed herein provides a tractable means for future addition of molecular data,and also serves to highlight histologic similarities and differences betweenhuman and canine glioma.

At 2 years postdiagnosis, weassessed nonadherence, defined as not taking ET every day or missing more thantwo pills in the past 14 days, discontinuation, and a composite measure ofunderuse, defined as either missing pills or discontinuing completely. Usinglogistic regression, we evaluated the relationship between race and nonadherence,discontinuation, and overall underuse in unadjusted, clinically adjusted, andsocioeconomically adjusted models.Results: A total of 1280 women were included; 43.2% self-identified as black.Compared to white women, black women more often reported nonadherence (13.7% vs5.2%) but not discontinuation (10.0% vs 10.7%). Black women also more oftenreported the following: hot flashes, night sweats, breast sensitivity, and jointpain; believing that their recurrence risk would not change if they stopped ET;forgetting to take ET; and cost-related barriers. In multivariable analysis,black race remained statistically significantly associated with nonadherenceafter adjusting for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.72, 95%confidence interval = 1.75 to 4.24) and after adding socioeconomic to clinicalcharacteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.50 to3.97) but was not independently associated with discontinuation after adjustment.Low recurrence risk perception and lack of a shared decision making were stronglypredictive of ET underuse across races.Conclusions: Our results highlight important racial differences in ET-adherencebehaviors, perceptions of benefits/harms, and shared decision making that may betargeted with culturally tailored interventions.

Electronic address:rbarkin@rush.edu.^Patients experiencing a terminal drug related event reflect a sentinel event. Ifthis pharmacotherapy is a widely used agent, it may be viewed as a catastrophicproblem. If patients are dying from illegal drug use when the medicalestablishment fails them by withdrawing or minimizing their medically prescribedmedication, then the burden rests with their health care providers, legislation,and insurance carriers to actively participate in a collegial fashion to achieveparity. Causing a decay in functionality in previously functional patients, mayoccur with appropriately prescribed opioid medications addressing non-cancer painwhen withdrawing or diminishing either with or without patient consent. Themembers of the medical profession have diminished their prescribing of opioidsfor their patients out of apparent fear of reprisal, state or federal governmentsanctions, and other concerned groups. Diminishing former dosages or deleting theopioid medication, preferably in concert with the patient, often results ininequitable patient care. Enforcing sanctioned decreases or ceasing to prescribefrom their former required/established opioid medications precipitate patientdiscord. In absence of opioid misuse, abuse, diversion or addiction based uponmedical "guidelines" and with a poor foundation of Evidence Based Medicine theCDC guidelines, it may be masked as a true guideline reflecting a decrement ofclinical judgment, wisdom, and compassion. This article also discusses the roleof pharmacy chains, insurance carriers, and their pharmacy benefit managers(PBMs) contribution to this multidimensional problem. There may be a potentialsolution, identified in this paper, if all the associated political, medical andinsurance groups work cohesively to improve patient care.

Interrupted time series analyses using Poissonregression models in which facility was considered a random effect were used toevaluate differences between monthly screening volumes during the 12-monthpreadoption period and the 12-month postadoption period (with the two periodsseparated by a 3-month lag) and to test for changes in month-to-monthfacility-level screening volume during the preadoption and postadoption periods.RESULTS: Across five regional breast imaging registries, 15 of 83 facilities(18.1%) adopted DBT for screening between 2011 and 2014. Most had no academicaffiliation (73.3% [11/15]), were nonprofit (80.0% [12/15]), and were generalradiology practices (66.7% [10/15]). Facility-level monthly screening volumeswere slightly higher during the postadoption versus preadoption periods (relativerisk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11). Monthly screening volumes remainedrelatively stable within the preadoption period (RR, 1.00 per month; 95% CI1.00-1.01 per month) and the postadoption period (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01 permonth).CONCLUSION: In a cohort of facilities with varied characteristics, monthlyscreening examination volumes did not decrease after DBT adoption.

It introduced insurance plans for prescription drugcoverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, whether they were enrolled in FFS ormanaged care (Medicare Advantage) plans. The availability of drug coveragebeginning in 2006 served to free up budgets for FFS Medicare enrollees that couldbe used to make copayments for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using endoscopy(colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy). In 2007, Medicare eliminated the copaymentsrequired by seniors for CRC screening by endoscopy. Later in 2008, CRC screeningby colonoscopy became part of the gold standard for CRC screening. Thislegitimized its use and offered even further encouragement to seniors, who mayhave been reluctant to undergo the procedure because of the non-pecuniary risksassociated with it. In addition, 37 CRC screening interventions occurred duringthis timeframe to enhance compliance with screening standards. Using multilevelanalysis of individuals' endoscopy utilization, derived from 100% FFS Medicareclaims, along with county-level market and contextual factors, we compare theperiods before and after the MMA (2001-2005 to 2006-2009) to determine whetherdisparities in the utilization of endoscopic CRC screening occurred or changedover the decade. We examined Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics relative to Whites,and Females relative to Males (with race or ethnicity combined). We examined eachstate separately for evidence of disparities within states, to avoid confoundingby geographic disparities. We expected that the net effect of the policy changesand the targeted interventions over the decade would be to increase CRC screeningby endoscopy, reducing disparities. We saw improvements over time (reduceddisparities relative to Whites) for Blacks and Hispanics residing in severalstates, and improvements over time for Females relative to Males in many states.For the vast majority of states, however, disparities persisted with Whites andMales exhibiting greater rates of utilization than other groups. States thatundertook the interventions were more likely to have had improvements indisparities or positive disparities for women and minorities. While some gainswere made over this time period, the gains were unevenly distributed across theUSA and more work needs to be done to reduce remaining disparities.

SCCOHT ischaracterized by a diploid genome with loss of SMARCA4 and lack of SMARCA2expression, two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelingcomplex. We and others have identified the histone methyltransferase EZH2 as apromising therapeutic target for SCCOHT, suggesting that SCCOHT cells depend onthe alternation of epigenetic pathways for survival. In this study, we found thatSCCOHT cells were more sensitive to pan-HDAC inhibitors compared to other ovariancancer lines or immortalized cell lines tested. Pan-HDAC inhibitors, such asquisinostat, reversed the expression of a group of proteins that were deregulatedin SCCOHT cells due to SMARCA4 loss, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis anddifferentiation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth of xenografted tumors ofSCCOHT cells. Moreover, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitorsat sub-lethal doses synergistically induced histone H3K27 acetylation and targetgene expression, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis and growth suppressionof SCCOHT cells and xenografted tumors. Therefore, our preclinical studyhighlighted the therapeutic potential of combined treatment of HDAC inhibitorswith EZH2 catalytic inhibitors to treat SCCOHT.^Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.

Weexamined the joint effect of social support, social relationship strain, andrural-urban residence on stage at breast cancer diagnosis.METHODS: Using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (n = 161,808), wedescribe the distribution of social, behavioral, and clinical factors byrural-urban residence among postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer(n = 7,120). We used rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes to categorizebaseline residential addresses as urban, large rural city/town, or small ruraltown, and the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results staging system tocategorize breast cancer stage at diagnosis (dichotomized as early or late). Wethen used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to estimate oddsratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for therelationship between rural-urban residence and stage at breast cancer diagnosis.We included separate interaction terms between rural-urban residence and socialstrain and social support to test for statistical interaction.RESULTS: Of the social, behavioral, and clinical factors we examined, onlyyounger age at WHI enrollment screening was significantly associated with latestage at breast cancer diagnosis (p = 0.003). Contrary to our hypothesis,rural-urban residence was not significantly associated with stage at breastcancer diagnosis among postmenopausal women ([adjusted OR, 95% CI] for urbancompared with small town: 1.08 [0.76-1.53]; large town compared with small town:1.16 [0.74-1.84]; and urban compared with large town: 0.93 [0.68-1.26]).Theassociations did not vary by social support or social strain (p for interactionbetween RUCA and social strain and social support, respectively: 0.99 and 0.17).CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should examine other potential effect modifiers toidentify novel factors predictive or protective for late stage at breast cancerdiagnosis associated with rural-urban residence.

However, to date, the combinationof PD1/PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) andantigen-presenting cells has been only minimally reported in breast carcinoma, inparticular in relation to HER2-positive cases. The goal of this study was toevaluate both cellular tumoral immune reaction and PD-L1/PD1 distribution inHER2-positive cases, as well as any associations with clinical outcome usingconventional chemotherapy combined with HER2 blocking. Multicolorimmunohistochemical multiplex assays simultaneously demonstrating PD1, PD-L1, andCD8 or PD-L1, CD3, and CD163 were performed on tissue microarrays (TMA)representing 216 pretreatment cases of HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma.PD-L1 expression was identified in 38 cases (18%), including 12 cases (6%) withPD-L1 labeling of tumor cells and 26 cases (12%) with PD-L1 labeling of immunecells only. Ten of 12 cases with PD-L1 staining of tumor cells showed staining ofassociated immune cells as well. With this assay method, PD1 was detectable inmany fewer cases (6 cases or 3%). PD-L1 expression was positively associated withhigh Nottingham grade, negative ER and PR, the absence of lymph node metastasis,and high levels of CD8+ cells. The overall survival by univariate analysis waspositively associated with lower tumor stage, the absence of lymph nodemetastasis, PD-L1 expression, and high levels of CD8+ cells. Therefore, our datasuggest cytotoxic immune reaction mediated by CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1expression may predict a better outcome in patients with HER2-positive breastcarcinoma managed with conventional chemotherapy and HER2-blocking therapy.

Phase-change contrast agents (PCCAs) are dynamic imaging agents withpractical applications in both the research and clinical settings. PCCAs possesscharacteristics that allow for cellular uptake where they can be converted fromliquid-phase PCCAs to gaseous microbubbles via ultrasound energy. Previously, wereported successful internalization of folate-targeted PCCAs in MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells followed by ultrasound-mediated activation to produce internalizedmicrobubbles. This study examines the binding, internalization and activation offolate-receptor targeted PCCAs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as a function ofgaseous core compositions, incubation time and ultrasound exposure period. Invitro results indicate that internalization and ultrasound-mediated activation ofPCCAs were significantly greater using a 50:50 mixture ofdecafluorobutane:dodecafluoropentane compared with other core compositions: 50:50octafluoropropane:decafluorobutane (p < 0.0001), decafluorobutane (p < 0.04) anddodecafluoropentane (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, it was found that PCCAs composedof perfluorocarbons with higher boiling points responded with greater activationefficiency when exposed to 12s of ultrasound exposure as opposed to 4s ofultrasound exposure. When evaluating different incubation times, it was foundthat incubating the PCCAs with breast cancer cells for 60min did not producesignificantly greater internalization and activation compared with incubation for10 min; this was concluded after comparing the number of microbubbles present percell before ultrasound versus post-ultrasound, and finding a ratio ofintracellular microbubbles post-ultrasound/pre-ultrasound, 3.46 versus 3.14,respectively.

In this study,we used a heterobifunctional cross-linker to conjugate docetaxel (DX) tocetuximab (CET) or panitumumab (PAN). The resulting ADCs were investigated fortheir in vitro EGFR-specific cytotoxicity and in vivo anticancer activity.Reaction conditions, such as reducing agent, time, temperature, and alkylationbuffer, were optimized to yield potent and stable ADCs with consistentbatch-to-batch drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs). ADCs were synthesized with DARsfrom 0.4 to 3.0, and all retained their EGFR affinity and specificity aftermodification. ADCs were sensitive to cell surface wildtype EGFR expression,demonstrating more cytotoxicity in EGFR-expressing A431 and MDA-MB-231 cell linescompared to U87MG cells. A431 tumor-bearing mice treated once weekly for fourweeks with 100 mg/kg cetuximab-docetaxel ADC (C-SC-DX, DAR 2.5) showed durableanticancer responses and improved overall survival compared to the same treatmentregimen with 1 mg/kg DX, 100 mg/kg CET, or a combination 1 mg/kg DX and 100 mg/kgCET. New treatment options are emerging for patients with both wild-type andmutated EGFR-overexpressing cancers, and these studies highlight the potentialrole of EGFR-targeted ADC therapies as a promising new treatment option.

ER agonists and antagonists areidentified with end-point assays, quantifying changes in cellular proliferationor gene transactivation in monolayers of estrogen receptor alpha expressing (ER+)cells upon exposure. While these monolayer cultures can be prepared, dosed, andanalyzed in a highly parallelized manner, they are unable to predict thepotencies of ER modulators in vivo accurately. Physiologically relevant modelsystems that better predict tissue- or organ-level responses are needed. Toaddress this need, we describe here a screening platform capable ofquantitatively assessing ER modulators in 96 chemically isolated 3D cultures.These cultures are supported in wax-patterned paper scaffolds whose design hasimproved performance and throughput over previously described paper-based setups.To highlight the potential of paper-based cultures for toxicity screens, wemeasured the potency of known ER modulators with a luciferase-based reporterassay. We also quantified the proliferation and invasion of two ER+ cell lines inthe presence of estradiol. Despite the inability of the current setup to betterpredict in vivo potencies of ER modulators than monolayer cultures, the resultsdemonstrate the potential of this platform to support increasingly complex andphysiologically relevant tissue-like structures for environmental chemical riskassessment.

Blood was collected pre-dose and up to 6 h post-dose. Urinarybiomarkers [KIM-1, calbindin, clusterin, GST-pi, β2M, albumin, NGAL, osteopontin,clusterin, MCP-1, cystatin C, and TFF3] were measured at baseline, days 3 and 10.Total and unbound platinum concentrations were measured using ICP/MS.Noncompartmental analysis was performed, and correlation and regression analysesevaluated the relationships between platinum pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity.RESULTS: Peak platinum urinary concentrations correlated with urinary levels ofKIM-1, calbindin, clusterin, GST-pi, β2M, albumin, NGAL, osteopontin, clusterin,cystatin C, and TFF3 at day 10. Unbound platinum plasma concentrations at 2 halso correlated with urinary clusterin, β2M, cystatin C, NGAL, osteopontin, andTFF3 at day 3. Regression analyses suggested 2-h total plasma platinumconcentrations greater than 2000 ng/ml, and peak urinary platinum concentrationsabove 24,000 ng/ml may serve as potential approximations for elevated risk ofnephrotoxicity. Platinum area under the plasma concentration time curve wasassociated with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate.CONCLUSIONS: Peak plasma and urinary platinum concentrations and pharmacokineticparameters were associated with risk of subclinical cisplatin-induced kidneyinjury as assessed using novel urinary biomarkers. Future studies will examinethese relationships in larger clinical populations of cisplatin-induced acutekidney injury.

To increase rates, the CDC recommendsclinics adhere to components of their evidence-based quality improvement program,AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange of information). We exploredfactors associated with engaging in HPV-specific AFIX-related activities. In2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 770pediatric and family medicine physicians in Florida and assessed vaccinationpractices, clinic characteristics, and HPV-related knowledge. Data were analyzedin 2017. The primary outcome was whether physicians' clinics engaged in ≥1 AFIXactivity. We stratified by physician specialty and developed multivariable modelsusing a backward selection approach. Of the participants in the analytic sample(n = 340), 52% were male, 60% were White of any ethnicity, and 55% werenon-Hispanic. Pediatricians and family medicine physicians differed on: yearspracticing medicine (p < 0.001), HPV-related knowledge (p < 0.001), and VFCprovider status (p < 0.001), among others. Only 39% of physicians reportedengaging in ≥1 AFIX activity. In the stratified multivariable model forpediatricians, AFIX activity was significantly associated with HPV-relatedknowledge (aOR = 1.33;95%CI = 1.08-1.63) and provider use of vaccine reminderprompts (aOR = 3.61;95%CI = 1.02-12.77). For family medicine physicians,HPV-related knowledge was significant (aOR = 1.57;95%CI = 1.20-2.05) as wasmajority race of patient population (non-Hispanic White vs. Other:aOR = 3.02;95%CI = 1.08-8.43), daily patient load (<20 vs. 20-24:aOR = 9.05;95%CI = 2.72-30.10), and vaccine administration to male patients(aOR = 2.98;95%CI = 1.11-8.02). Fewer than half of Florida pediatric and familymedicine physicians engaged in any AFIX activities. Future interventions toincrease AFIX engagement should focus on implementing and evaluating AFIXactivities in groups identified as having low engagement in AFIX activities.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compareincidence of PCa diagnosis, metastatic PCa, Gleason score 8-10 PCa, and PCamortality among 5ARI users (n = 4 571), α-blocker users (n = 7 764) and non-users(n = 11 677).RESULTS: In comparison with both non-users and α-blocker users, 5ARI users had a~40% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis (11.0% and 11.4% vs 5.8%, respectively), andα-blocker users had an 11% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis compared with non-users.Overall, the incidence of metastatic PCa and PCa mortality was not significantlydifferent among 5ARI or α-blocker users compared with non-users (adjusted hazardratios [HR] of metastatic PCa: 1.12 and 1.13, respectively, and PCa mortality:1.11 and 1.18, respectively, P > 0.05 for both drugs), but both 5ARI anda-blocker users had ~30% higher risk of Gleason score 8-10 cancer, adjusted HR1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.82, P = 0.03, and adjusted HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, respectively compared with non-users.CONCLUSION: The use of 5ARIs was associated with lower risk of PCa diagnosis,regardless of comparison group. Risk of high grade PCa was higher among both 5ARIusers and α-blocker users compared with non-users; however, this did nottranslate into higher risk of PCa mortality.^© 2018 The Authors BJU International © 2018 BJU International Published by JohnWiley & Sons Ltd.

We aimed to investigate the effects of apalutamide versus placeboadded to androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).METHODS: SPARTAN is a multicentre, international, randomised, phase 3 trial.Participants were aged 18 years or older, with non-metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen doubling timeof 10 months or less, and a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 2 ng/mL ormore in serum. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 240 mg oral apalutamideper day plus androgen deprivation therapy, or matched oral placebo plus androgendeprivation therapy, using an interactive voice randomisation system. Permutedblock randomisation was used according to the three baseline stratificationfactors: prostate-specific antigen doubling time (>6 months vs ≤6 months), use ofbone-sparing drugs (yes vs no), and presence of local-regional nodal disease (N0vs N1). Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The primary endpoint wasmetastasis-free survival. The trial was unblinded in July, 2017. In thisprespecified exploratory analysis we assessed HRQOL using the FunctionalAssessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, whichwe collected at baseline, day 1 of cycle 1 (before dose), day 1 of treatmentcycles 1-6, day 1 of every two cycles from cycles 7 to 13, and day 1 of everyfour cycles thereafter. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT01946204.FINDINGS: Between Oct 14, 2013, and Dec 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 1207patients to receive apalutamide (n=806) or placebo (n=401). The clinical cutoffdate, as for the primary analysis, was May 19, 2017. Median follow-up for overallsurvival was 20·3 months (IQR 14·8-26·6). FACT-P total and subscale scores wereassociated with a preservation of HRQOL from baseline to cycle 29 in theapalutamide group; there were similar results for EQ-5D-3L. At baseline, the meanfor FACT-P total score in both the apalutamide and placebo groups were consistentwith the FACT-P general population norm for US adult men. Group meanpatient-reported outcome scores over time show that HRQOL was maintained frombaseline after initiation of apalutamide treatment and was similar over timeamong patients receiving apalutamide versus placebo. Least-squares mean changefrom baseline shows that HRQOL deterioration was more apparent in the placebogroup.INTERPRETATION: In asymptomatic men with high-risk non-metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer, HRQOL was maintained after initiation ofapalutamide treatment. Considered with findings from SPARTAN, patients whoreceived apalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival and longer time tosymptomatic progression than did those who received placebo, while preservingHRQOL.FUNDING: Janssen Research & Development.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

KSHV haslatent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute toviral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis.Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA,and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify hostchromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition,we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins fortheir ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulatorsof viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi1, PTC-209, two additional histonedeacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomaininhibitor (+)-JQ1. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viralgenome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin,Panobinostat, and PTC-209 induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, andresults in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi1 inducesKSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi1, a member of the Polycomb repressivecomplex 1, is critical for maintaining KSHV latency.

It is associated with a poor prognosis, and improvedtherapies for women battling USCs are greatly needed. ONC201 is an orallybioavailable, first-in-class small molecule that induces tumor necrosisfactor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) independent of p53. ONC201 hasdemonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity in pre-clinical models of solid tumorsthrough induction of apoptosis and inactivation of the AKT/MAPK pathways. Recentphase I and II clinical trials have shown that ONC201 is well tolerated and mayhave single agent activity in high grade glioma patients among others. We soughtto determine the effects of ONC201 on cell proliferation in USC and identify themechanisms by which ONC201 inhibits cell growth in this disease. ONC201 inhibitedcell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in ARK1, ARK2 and SPEC-2 celllines. The anti-proliferative activity of ONC201 in ARK1 and SPEC-2 cells wasassociated with induction apoptosis independent of p53 via both a TRAIL mediatedapoptotic pathway and a mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Treatment with ONC201resulted in significant reduction in adhesion and invasion as well as inhibitionof the AKT and MAPK pathways. In addition, ONC201 markedly potentiated theanti-tumorigenic effects of paclitaxel in USC cells. Our results suggest thatONC201 has significant anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects in USCcells through both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the AKT and MAPKpathways. ONC201 and paclitaxel are a promising therapeutic combination in USCcells. Thus, ONC201 should be evaluated as a single agent and as a therapeuticpartner with paclitaxel in future clinical trials of USC.

Talimogene laherparepvec, a genetically modified herpes simplex virustype 1 (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in tumors to induce lytic cell death,tumor antigen release, and the local production of granulocyte-macrophagecolony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been approved for the treatment of adefined population of patients with metastatic melanoma. Talimogene laherparepvecis administered as a series of intralesional injections, and specific proceduresare implemented to minimize the risk of viral exposure. Because talimogenelaherparepvec represents a novel therapeutic modality, its preparation,administration, and handling requirements differ from current therapies;pharmacists have an important role in developing new procedures to incorporate itinto clinical practice. Methods: In this review, pharmacists with experiencedispensing talimogene laherparepvec, in the clinical trial setting and/or as acommercially available product at US academic institutions, synthesized theirpersonal experiences through group discussions to provide insights on theordering, receipt, storage, preparation, administration, and handling oftalimogene laherparepvec. Results: Suggestions for patient education andpractical guidance to assist hospital pharmacists and decision makers withimplementing talimogene laherparepvec at their institutions are provided.Conclusion: These insights may further inform the development of policies orprocedures to incorporate talimogene laherparepvec into clinical settings andimprove patient outcomes.

Although experimental evidence supports calcium and vitamin Dpotentially modifying these proinflammatory pathways in the colorectum, humandata in these regards are scarce. We investigated supplemental calcium (1,200 mgdaily) and/or vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily) effects on inflammatory signalingpathway-related biomarkers in a subset of 105 participants from a colorectaladenoma recurrence chemoprevention clinical trial. We assessed expression of TLR4and TLR5, which recognize the bacterial components lipopolysaccharides andflagellin, respectively, and phospho-IKKα/β (pIKKα/β), a biomarker ofinflammation, in the normal-appearing rectal crypt epithelium and stroma usingstandardized, automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis.Following 1 year of treatment, TLR4, TLR5, and pIKKα/β expression in the rectalmucosa did not statistically significantly change with vitamin D or calciumsupplementation, taken alone or in combination. Several baseline participantcharacteristics, including body mass index, history of sessile serrated adenomas,high red/processed meat intake, and high levels of rectal epithelial cellproliferation (as measured by MIB-1/Ki-67), were associated with higher baselineexpression of TLRs or pIKKα/β. Our findings suggest that vitamin D and calciummay have no substantial effect on the investigated biomarkers. However, severalmodifiable lifestyle factors may be associated with TLRs and pIKKα/β expressionin the normal rectal mucosa, supporting their future investigation as potentiallytreatable, preneoplastic risk factors for colorectal neoplasms.

The role of the tumor stroma in thedevelopment of these mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors remainsunclear. We demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of the TGFβ signalingpathway synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy butfailed to augment anti-PD-1/PD-L1 responses in an autochthonous model ofBRAFV600E melanoma. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that TGFβ pathwayinhibition promoted the proliferative expansion of stromal fibroblasts, therebyfacilitating MMP-9-dependent cleavage of PD-L1 surface expression, leading toanti-PD-1 resistance in this model. Further work demonstrated that melanomasescaping anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype associated withenhanced TGFβ signaling activity. Delayed TGFβ inhibitor therapy, followinganti-PD-1 escape, better served to control further disease progression and wassuperior to a continuous combination of anti-PD-1 and TGFβ inhibition. This workillustrates that formulating immunotherapy combination regimens to enhance theefficacy of checkpoint blockade requires an in-depth understanding of the impactof these agents on the tumor microenvironment. These data indicated that stromalfibroblast MMP-9 may desensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 and suggests that TGFβinhibition may generate greater immunologic efficacy when administered followingthe development of acquired anti-PD-1 resistance.

Cronbach'salpha (α), confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), item-response theory (IRT)analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were used to evaluateinternal consistency and validity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The revised MHI retained the 13 best-fitting items fromthe MHI-17 and resulted in a final model that included two subscales: anxiety(four items, RMSEA 0.11; CFI 0.99; TLI 0.98) and depression (9 items, RMSEA 0.10;CFI 0.96; TL 0.95). IRT analyses of the four anxiety items indicated good fit(RMSEA 0.08) and precise measurement of adults with poor mental health, and thenine depression items also fit well (RMSEA 0.05). No meaningful differences werefound by sex, education, or treatment stage. Scores were developed to providemeaningful norms. The new MHI-13 is a shorter, more accurate way to assess mentalhealth in older adults with cancer and most importantly allows clinicians toseparately identify anxiety and/or depression - a clinically importantdistinction as treatment differs among these two types of mental healthimpairment.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Breastfeeding Programs and Policies, Breastfeeding Uptake, and Maternal HealthOutcomes in Developed Countries [Internet].^Feltner C(1), Weber RP(1), Stuebe A(1), Grodensky CA(1), Orr C(1), ViswanathanM(1).Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2018 Jul. ReportNo.: 18-EHC014-EF.AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.^Author information:(1)RTI International–University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-basedPractice Center^OBJECTIVES: To summarize the effectiveness of community, workplace, and healthcare system–based programs and policies aimed at supporting and promotingbreastfeeding and determine the association between breastfeeding and maternalhealth.DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed®/MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL®from January 1, 1980, to October 12, 2017, for studies relevant to theeffectiveness of health care system–based, workplace, and community breastfeedingprograms and policies. For evidence on breastfeeding and maternal health, weupdated the 2007 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report on this topicand searched the same databases from November 1, 2005, to October 12, 2017. Forstudies of breastfeeding programs and policies, trials, systematic reviews, andobservational studies with a control group were eligible; we excluded primarycare–based programs delivered as part of routine care. For studies related tobreastfeeding and maternal health, we included systematic reviews, case-controlstudies, and cohort studies.REVIEW METHODS: Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data from,and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies; they graded the strength ofevidence (SOE) using established criteria. We synthesized all evidencequalitatively.RESULTS: We included 128 studies (137 publications) and 10 systematic reviews. Ofthese, 40 individual studies were relevant to the effectiveness of breastfeedingprograms or policies, and the remainder were relevant to one or more maternalhealth outcomes. Based on evidence from one large randomized controlled trial(RCT) (Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial [PROBIT], N=17,046)enrolling mothers who intended to breastfeed and nine cohort studies (1,227,182women), we graded the SOE for the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) asmoderate for improving rates of breastfeeding duration. Evidence from eightcohort studies of BFHI (135,983 women) also demonstrates improved rates ofbreastfeeding initiation (low SOE). Low SOE (k=4 studies; 1,532 women) supportsthe conclusion that health care education or training of staff alone (withoutadditional breastfeeding support services) does not improve breastfeedinginitiation rates. Women, Infants and Children (WIC, a Federal supplementalnutrition program) interventions that focus on peer support are effective inimproving rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration (low SOE). We foundlimited evidence for other (community-based) interventions and no comparativestudies on workplace or school-based interventions or harms associated withinterventions. For maternal health outcomes, low SOE supports the conclusion thatever breastfeeding or breastfeeding for longer durations may be associated withlower rates of breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, hypertension, and type 2diabetes, but not fractures. Because of heterogeneity and inconsistent results,we found insufficient evidence on whether breastfeeding is associated withpostpartum depression, cardiovascular disease, or postpartum weight change.CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence for breastfeeding programs and policies wasdiverse in terms of interventions and settings. Current evidence supports thebenefit of BFHI for improving rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration;however, evidence from one large RCT (PROBIT) has limited applicability, andobservational studies do not clearly establish the magnitude of benefit. Forwomen enrolled in WIC, low SOE supports peer-support interventions for improvingbreastfeeding outcomes. The identified associations between breastfeeding andimproved maternal health outcomes are supported by evidence from observationalstudies, which cannot determine cause-and-effect relationships.

This study was designed to assess the feasibility and resourcerequirements associated with implementing PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial.Methods Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled in the NationalCancer Institute-sponsored North Central Cancer Treatment Group (Alliance)Preoperative Radiation or Selective Preoperative Radiation and Evaluation beforeChemotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision trial were asked to self-report 30PRO-CTCAE items weekly from home during preoperative therapy, and every 6 monthsafter surgery, via either the Web or an automated telephone system. Ifparticipants did not self-report within 3 days, a central coordinator called themto complete the items. Compliance was defined as the proportion of participantswho completed PRO-CTCAE assessments at expected time points. Results Theprespecified PRO-CTCAE analysis was conducted after the 500th patient completedthe 6-month follow-up (median age, 56 years; 33% female; 12% nonwhite; 43% highschool education or less; 5% Spanish speaking), across 165 sites. PRO-CTCAE wasreported by participants at 4,491 of 4,882 expected preoperative time points(92.0% compliance), of which 3,771 (77.2%) were self-reported by participants and720 (14.7%) were collected via central coordinator backup. Compliance at 6-monthpost-treatment follow-up was 333 of 468 (71.2%), with 122 (26.1%) via backup.Site research associates spent a median of 15 minutes on PRO-CTCAE work for eachpatient visit. Work by a central coordinator required a 50% time commitment.Conclusion Home-based reporting of PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial is feasible,with high patient compliance and low site administrative requirements. PRO-CTCAEdata capture is improved through centralized backup calls.

Many patients have questions regarding clinicalmanagement options. Online research forums may help researchers and providersidentify research areas of interest. Our objective was to review online forumsand identify research questions that are important to patients and familiesimpacted by bladder cancer diagnosis.METHODS: We reviewed 1 month of online content from the Bladder Cancer AdvocacyNetwork Inspire online community (https://www.inspire.com/groups/bladder-cancer-advocacy-network ). Using affinitydiagramming, we categorized the submitted content from patient users into themesstratified by the cancer severity of the patient user (non-muscle-invasivebladder cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, metastatic bladder cancer). Wecategorized the content by the audience of forum posts (i.e., inwardly directed,those seeking support, vs. outwardly directed, those sharing personalexperiences) and constructed comparative effectiveness research questions fromthe submitted content.RESULTS: From 14 July 2014 to 14 August 2014, a total of 394 forum posts werecollected, of which 3 were excluded from analysis due to non-relevant content,leaving 391 comments for final analysis. Almost 38% of posts involvedmuscle-invasive bladder cancer and 25% of posts were from people other than thepatient. Inwardly and outwardly directed posts were commonly related to clinicaltreatment concerns.CONCLUSIONS: Review of online patient-generated content may offer insight intocomparative effectiveness research topics of importance to bladder cancerpatients. A more formalized process may better represent research prioritiesamong bladder cancer patients.

We evaluated the risk of breast cancer in relation to exposure totoxic metallic substances in air, individually and combined, in a U.S. widecohort.METHODS: We recruited Sister Study participants (n=50,884), breast cancer-freewomen who had a sister with breast cancer, from 2003-2009. The 2005 EnvironmentalProtection Agency National Air Toxic Assessment's census-tract estimates of metalconcentrations in air (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead,manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were matched to participants'enrollment residence. We used Cox regression to estimate the association betweenquintiles of individual metals and breast cancer incidence and weighted quantilesum regression to model the association between the metal mixture and breastcancer.RESULTS: 2,587 breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up (mean=7.4years). In individual chemical analyses comparing the highest to lowestquintiles, postmenopausal breast cancer risk was elevated for mercury (hazardratio [HR]=1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.5), cadmium (HR=1.1, 95%CI:0.96-1.3), and lead (HR=1.1, 95%CI: 0.98-1.3). The weighted quantile sum indexwas associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (odds ratio (OR)=1.1, 95%CI:1.0-1.1). Consistent with the individual chemical analysis, the most highlyweighted chemicals for predicting postmenopausal breast cancer risk were lead,cadmium, and mercury. Results were attenuated for overall breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of some airborne metals, specifically mercury,cadmium, and lead, were associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breastcancer.

Theswallowing function was objectively scored for penetration, aspiration, andpharyngeal residue. Forty patients received de-intensified chemoradiation therapy(60 Gy image guided radiation therapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2) and 38patients received standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy (70 Gy image guidedradiation therapy with chemotherapy of the medical oncologist's choosing).Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect differences betweenthe cohorts with regard to laryngeal penetration, aspiration, and pharyngealresidue. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the overalleffect of treatment on the swallowing function. Patient-reported swallowingoutcomes in de-intensified cohort were assessed with the European Organisationfor Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Module for Head and NeckCancer and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common TerminologyCriteria for Adverse Events questionnaires.Results: Patients treated with de-intensified chemoradiation therapy wereassociated with a suggestion of lower risk of developing overall swallowingdysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; P = .07), laryngeal penetration (OR, 0.63;P = .12), and pharyngeal residue (OR, 0.61; P = .08). The mean pre- and 2-yearpost-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Lifescores pertaining to swallowing (1-4 scale, higher worse) in the de-intensifiedcohort were 1.4 and 1.2 for liquids; 1.2 and 1.1 for purees; 1.5 and 1.7 forsolids, 1.0 and 1.3 for choked when swallowing; and 9.0 and 10.8 for compositescore, respectively. The mean pre- and 2-year post-Patient-Reported Outcomesversion of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events swallowingdifficulty scores (1-5 scale, with higher scores being worse) were 1.5 and 1.8,respectively.Conclusions: Compared with 7 weeks of 70 Gy, 6 weeks of 60 Gy de-intensifiedchemoradiation therapy appears to better preserve the baseline swallowingfunction (per objective modified barium swallow assessment). Patients treatedwith de-intensified chemoradiation therapy reported minimal changes in swallowingfunction.

Non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and over 60% expresswild-type EGFR (wtEGFR); however, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) havelimited effect in most patients with wtEGFR tumors. We previously identifiedMERTK tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC and developedMRX-2843, a novel MERTK-selective inhibitor with favorable properties forclinical translation. The goal of this study was to determine whether MERTK andEGFR inhibitor combination therapy could provide antitumor efficacy againstwtEGFR NSCLC.Experimental Design: An unbiased screen of 378 kinase inhibitors wasconducted to identify synergistic interactions with MRX-2843 and biochemical andtherapeutic effects were determined in vitro and in vivo Results: Numerousirreversible EGFR TKIs, including CO-1686 and osimertinib, synergized withMRX-2843 to inhibit wtEGFR NSCLC cell expansion, irrespective of driver oncogenestatus. CO-1686 and MRX-2843 combination therapy inhibited MERTK, wtEGFR, andERBB2/ERBB3 and decreased downstream PI3K-AKT, MAPK-ERK, and AURORA kinase (AURK)signaling more effectively than single agents. Inhibition of PI3K, AKT or AURK,but not MEK, synergized with CO-1686 to inhibit tumor cell expansion, suggestingtheir roles as key redundant resistance pathways. Treatment with MRX-2843 andCO-1686 or osimertinib prevented xenograft growth while single agents had limitedeffect. Tumor growth inhibition was durable even after treatment with combinationtherapy was stopped.Conclusions: Our data support the application of MRX-2843 incombination with an irreversible EGFR TKI as a novel strategy for treatment ofpatients with wtEGFR NSCLC.

Allthree complexes showed unstructured emission near 618 nm from a tripletmetal-to-ligand charge transfer (3 MLCT) state with a lifetime (τem ) ofapproximately 1 μs. Transient absorption measurements revealed an additionalexcited state that was nonemissive and long-lived (τTA  = 43 μs for 2 and 27 μsfor 3), assigned as a triplet intraligand (3 IL) state that was accessible onlyin 2 and 3. All three complexes were strong singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) sensitizers,with quantum yields (Φ∆ ) for 2 and 3 being the largest (74-78%), and all threewere photocytotoxic to cancer cells with visible light activation in the order:3 > 2 > 1. Cell-free DNA photodamage followed the same trend, where potencyincreased with decreasing 3 IL energy. Compounds 2 and 3 also showed in vitrophotobiological effects with red light (625 nm), where their molar absorptivitieswere <100 m-1  cm-1 . These findings highlight that Ru(II) dyads derived fromα-oligothiophenes directly appended to 1,10-phenanthroline-namely 2 and 3-possesslow-lying 3 IL states that are highly photosensitizing, and they may therefore beof interest for photobiological applications such as photodynamic therapy (PDT).^© 2018 The American Society of Photobiology.

The consortium comprises a coordinating center, six funded extramuralclinical projects, and an ongoing National Human Genome Research Institute(NHGRI) intramural project. Collectively, these projects aim to enroll andsequence over 6,100 participants in four years. At least 60% of participants willbe of non-European ancestry or from underserved settings, with the goal ofdiversifying the populations that are providing an evidence base for genomicmedicine. Five of the six clinical projects are enrolling pediatric patients withvarious phenotypes. One of these five projects is also enrolling couples whosefetus has a structural anomaly, and the sixth project is enrolling adults at riskfor hereditary cancer. The ongoing NHGRI intramural project has enrolledprimarily healthy adults. Goals of the consortium include assessing the clinicalutility of genomic sequencing, exploring medical follow up and cascade testing ofrelatives, and evaluating patient-provider-laboratory level interactions thatinfluence the use of this technology. The findings from the CSER consortium willoffer patients, healthcare systems, and policymakers a clearer understanding ofthe opportunities and challenges of providing genomic medicine in diversepopulations and settings, and contribute evidence toward developing bestpractices for the delivery of clinically useful and cost-effective genomicsequencing in diverse healthcare settings.^Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.

Mass spectrometry hasbeen shown to be an important tool for dereplication of complex natural productsamples. In addition, chromatographic separation and complementary spectroscopicanalysis (e.g., UV) can enhance the confidence of the dereplication process.Here, we applied a droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probe (dropletprobe) coupled with UPLC-PDA-HRMS-MS/MS to identify two new natural products insitu from the freshwater strain Calothrix sp. UIC 10520. This allowed us toprioritize this strain for chemical investigation based on the presence of newmetabolites very early in our discovery process, saving both time and resources.Subsequently, calothrixamides A (1) and B (2) were isolated from large-scalecultures, and the structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy andmass spectrometry. The absolute configurations were determined by a combinationof chemical degradation reactions, derivatization methods (Mosher's, Marfey's,and phenylglycine methyl ester), and J-based configurational analysis.Calothrixamides showed no cytotoxic activity against the MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231,and OVCAR3 cancer cell lines. They represent the first functionalized long-chainfatty acid amides reported from the Calothrix genus and from a freshwatercyanobacterium.

Patients in each group received0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before totalmesorectal excision. Patients were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapyafter surgery to complete a total of 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial was powered to detect differences inpathological complete response, which was reported previously. Disease-free andoverall survival are the main outcomes for the current study.RESULTS: Of 259 patients, 211 had a complete follow-up. Median follow-up was 59months (range, 9-125 mo). The mean number of total chemotherapy cycles differedamong the 4 groups (p = 0.002), because one third of patients in the groupassigned to no preoperative FOLFOX did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy.Disease-free survival was significantly associated with study group, ypTNM stage,and pathological complete response (p = 0.004, <0.001, and 0.001). A secondaryanalysis including only patients who received ≥1 cycle of FOLFOX still showeddifferences in survival between study groups (p = 0.03).LIMITATIONS: The trial was not randomized and was not powered to show differencesin survival. Survival data were not available for 19% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Adding modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiotherapy and before totalmesorectal excision increases compliance with systemic chemotherapy anddisease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Neoadjuvant consolidation chemotherapy may have benefits beyond increasingpathological complete response rates.

We searched PubMed for Englishlanguage articles published in peer-reviewed journals between Jan 1, 2001, andOct 30, 2017. Eligible articles were those that reported PRO results from RCTs ofadult patients with advanced breast cancer receiving anti-cancer treatments withreported sample sizes of at least 50 patients-66 RCTs met the selection criteria.Only eight (12%) RCTs reported a specific PRO research hypothesis. Heterogeneityin the statistical methods used to assess PRO data was observed, with a mixtureof longitudinal and cross-sectional techniques. Not all articles addressed theproblem of multiple testing. Fewer than half of RCTs (28 [42%]) reported theclinical significance of their findings. 48 (73%) did not report how missing datawere handled. Our systematic review shows a need to improve standards in theanalysis, interpretation, and reporting of PRO data in cancer RCTs. Lack ofstandardisation makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions and comparefindings across trials. The Setting International Standards in the AnalyzingPatient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Data Consortium was set up toaddress this need and develop recommendations on the analysis of PRO data inRCTs.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, andantitumor activity of TRC105 in combination with axitinib in patients withmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Heavily pretreated mRCC patients were treatedwith TRC105 weekly (8 mg/kg and then 10 mg/kg) in combination with axitinib(initially at 5 mg b.i.d. and then escalated per patient tolerance to a maximumof 10 mg b.i.d.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using astandard 3 + 3 phase I design.RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median number of prior therapies = 3) were treated.TRC105 dose escalation proceeded to 10 mg/kg weekly without dose-limitingtoxicity. Adverse event characteristics of each drug were not increased infrequency or severity when the two drugs were administered concurrently. TRC105and axitinib demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity, including partialresponses (PR) by RECIST in 29% of patients, and median progression-free survival(11.3 months). None of the patients with PR had PR to prior first-line treatment.Lower baseline levels of osteopontin and higher baseline levels of TGF-β receptor3 correlated with overall response rate.CONCLUSION: TRC105 at 8 and 10 mg/kg weekly was well tolerated in combinationwith axitinib, with encouraging evidence of activity in patients with mRCC. Amulticenter, randomized phase II trial of TRC105 and axitinib has recentlycompleted enrollment (NCT01806064).IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (CD105), areceptor densely expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and also on renalcancer stem cells that is implicated as a mediator of resistance to inhibitors ofthe VEGF pathway. In this Phase I trial, TRC105 combined safely with axitinib atthe recommended single agent doses of each drug in patients with renal cellcarcinoma. The combination demonstrated durable activity in a VEGFinhibitor-refractory population and modulated several angiogenic biomarkers. Arandomized Phase II trial testing TRC105 in combination with axitinib in clearcell renal cell carcinoma has completed accrual.^© AlphaMed Press 2018.

Electronic address:kngoto@p.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.^Several flavonoids and their biosynthetic precursor chalcones were designed andsynthesized to improve the biological effects of the lead compound2'-hydroxyflavonone against androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcriptionalstimulation. Newly synthesized chalcones 19 and 26 suppressed AR-dependenttranscription as well as DHT-dependent growth stimulation at a low micromolarlevel. These compounds were also effective against ligand-independentconstitutively active mutant AR derived from castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).Compounds 19 and 26 showed broad spectrum antiproliferative activity at 5-10 μMagainst multiple tumor cell lines including androgen-independent andtaxane-resistant prostate cancer as well as a multidrug-resistant subline. Modeof action studies suggested that 19 induced sub-G1 accumulation in PC-3 cells bydisrupting the microtubule network without affecting cell cycle progression.Furthermore, the in vivo effectiveness of chalcone 19 was confirmed in axenograft model antitumor assay. Thus, chalcone 19 has the potential to be abifunctional lead for treatment of AR-dependent PCa at lower doses as well asAR-independent PCa, including CRPC, at higher doses.

To identify opportunities for mobilizing parentsto increase HPV vaccination uptake, the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable andVaccinate Adolescents Against Cancers program convened two national meetings in2016 at the American Cancer Society. Stakeholders recommended a focus on positivemessage to parents; cultivating parent champions to use the power of personalstorytelling and to distribute these messages; and defining the role of nationalorganizations in supporting parent champions. Stakeholders supported threemessage themes: HPV vaccination is the norm, HPV vaccination is cancerprevention, and HPV vaccination supports families across generations. Parents'negative stories about vaccination are especially difficult to counteract withscientific evidence, making the cultivation of pro-vaccine parent champions anespecially promising intervention on social media and other informationplatforms.

The factors influencing livermetastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgentlyneeded. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes)derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce livermacrophage polarization toward an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-secreting pro-inflammatoryphenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA-21-5p (miR-21) was highlyenriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liverpro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC. Silencing either miR-21in CRC-sEVs or Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in macrophages, to which miR-21 binds,abolished CRC-sEVs' induction of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore,miR-21 expression in plasma-derived sEVs was positively correlated with livermetastasis in CRC patients. Collectively, our data demonstrate a pivotal role ofCRC-sEVs in promoting liver metastasis by inducing an inflammatory pre-metastaticniche through the miR-21-TLR7-IL6 axis. Thus, sEVs-miR-21 represents a potentialprognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis.

Methods The Clinically Localized Prostate Cancerguideline was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. An ASCO ExpertPanel then reviewed the content and the recommendations. Results The ASCO ExpertPanel determined that the recommendations from the Clinically Localized ProstateCancer guideline were clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevantscientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the Clinically Localized Prostate Cancerguideline except for two recommendations on cryosurgery. The two recommendationscovering cryosurgery were not endorsed because the panel found that there isinsufficient evidence to support the use of cryotherapy in this setting.Recommendations The ASCO Expert Panel endorsed all but two of the originalguideline recommendations as written and offered a series of discussion points toguide practice.

However, RNA-based genomic testscan be costly and are not available in many countries. Methods for inferringmolecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely tobenefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit frommolecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an imageanalysis approach using deep learning. A training set of 571 breast tumors wasused to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). Theresulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (n = 288), andaccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set.Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs.high tumor grade (82% accuracy), ER status (84% accuracy), Basal-like vs.non-Basal-like (77% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (94% accuracy), and high vs.low-medium ROR-PT score (75% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the trainingset minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status wassignificantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof ofprinciple that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker(i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >75% based on H&E features.Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greaterneed for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variablestypically accomplished using human-based scoring.

To facilitate expert input, ClinGen has formed Clinical Domain WorkingGroups (CDWGs) to leverage the collective knowledge of clinicians, laboratorydiagnosticians, and researchers. In the initial phase of ClinGen, CDWGs werelaunched in the cardiovascular, hereditary cancer, and inborn errors ofmetabolism clinical fields. These early CDWGs established the infrastructurenecessary to implement standardized processes developed or adopted by ClinGenworking groups for the interpretation of gene-disease associations and variantpathogenicity, and provided a sustainable model for the formation of futuredisease-focused curation groups. The establishment of CDWGs requires recruitmentof international experts to broadly represent the interests of their field andensure that assertions made are reliable and widely accepted. Building on thesuccesses, challenges, and trade-offs made in establishing the original CDWGs,ClinGen has developed standard operating procedures for the development of CDWGsin new clinical domains, while maximizing efforts to scale up curation andfacilitate involvement of external groups who wish to utilize ClinGen methods andinfrastructure for expert curation.

We assessed attitudes toward at-home HPV self-collectioncompared with clinic-based Pap testing in this higher-risk population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were low-income women in North Carolinaoverdue for cervical cancer screening. Women self-collected samples at home,returned samples by mail for HPV testing, and completed phone questionnairesabout at-home HPV self-collection. Participants were referred to clinic-based Paptesting and invited to complete a second questionnaire about Pap testing. Across-sectional questionnaire compared attitudes, experiences, and preferencesfor self-collection versus Pap testing and assessed predictors of preference forHPV self-collection.RESULTS: Half (51%) of 221 women reported a preference for HPV self-collection,19% preferred Pap testing, and 27% reported no preference. More women reporteddifficulty finding time to do the Pap test (31%) than the self-test (13%, p =.003) and being afraid of the self-test results (50%) than the Pap test results(36%, p = .02). There were relatively fewer reports of physical discomfort andpain from self-collection than Pap testing (discomfort: 18% self; 48% Pap; pain:8% self; 30% Pap, p = .001). No differences were found in positive versusnegative thoughts about the tests, trust in the tests' safety and accuracy, orwillingness to do tests again.CONCLUSIONS: Overall positive attitudes toward HPV self-collection compared withPap testing among underscreened women suggest that self-collection is a promisingoption to increase cervical cancer screening in this high-risk population.

Previousresearch found that scores from the original PActS scale were associated withparticipation in meaningful activity. Women of working age may have differentsocietal pressures than older adults, which could impact their quality of life.Our aims were to (i) adapt the scale specifically for women, (ii) test convergentand structural validity and (iii) test internal consistency reliability.METHOD: First, we completed a literature review to add new items, then measuredpsychometric properties of PActS-W.FINDINGS: A total of 186 women, one month after cancer surgery completed PActS-W.PActS-W demonstrated convergent-related (physical health r = 0.40, mental healthr = 0.30, P < 0.01), structural validity (CFI, 0.96; RMSEA, 0.10; IFI, 0.96, NFI,0.94) and high internal consistency reliability (stratified coefficientα = 0.90).CONCLUSION: The PActS-W may be useful for measuring women's internalised societalpressures after encountering cancer, which relates to their quality of life, butfurther testing is needed.^© 2018 Occupational Therapy Australia.

Thenumber of normal lymph nodes could indicate the number of nodes that need to beretrieved during the procedure. The aim of this study is to analyze the number oflymph nodes in cadavers without gastric cancer according to the Japanese GastricCancer Association guidelines. Twenty fresh adult cadavers (14 males, mean age55, range 24-93 years) were used. Abdominal lymph nodes were dissected andclassified according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. For totalgastrectomy, the median number of lymph nodes that comprised D1 + dissection was27 (range 15-42). The median and mean number of lymph nodes that comprised D2dissection was 33, ranging from 18 to 50. For distal gastrectomy, the D1 + levelcomprised a median of 21 lymph nodes (range 11-38), and the D2 level 22 lymphnodes (range 11-39). In conclusion, considering gastrectomy + D2 lymphadenectomyas the standard treatment for gastric cancer, our results show that adequatelymphadenectomy must encompass around 30 lymph nodes. Clin.

Weaimed to report expert practice patterns and attitudes, specifically addressingthe minimum IDY in the use of AIMs in BE surveillance.METHODS: An international group of BE experts completed an anonymous electronicsurvey of domains relevant to surveillance practice patterns and use of AIMs. Theevaluated AIMs were conventional chromoendoscopy (CC), virtual chromoendoscopy(VC), volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE), confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE),and wide-area transepithelial sampling (WATS3D). Responses were recorded usingfive-point balanced Likert items and analyzed as continuous variables.RESULTS: The survey response rate was 84% (61/73)-41 US and 20 non-US. Expertswere most comfortable with and routinely use VC and CC, and least comfortablewith and rarely use VLE, CLE, and WATS3D. Experts rated data from randomizedcontrolled trials (1.4 ± 0.9) and guidelines (2.6 ± 1.2) as the two mostinfluential factors for implementing AIMs in clinical practice. The minimum IDYof AIMs over standard biopsies to be considered of clinical benefit was lowestfor VC (15%, IQR 10-29%) and highest for VLE (30%, IQR 20-50%). Compared to USexperts, non-US experts reported higher use of CC for BE surveillance(p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: These results should inform benchmarks that need to be met forguidelines to recommend the routine use of AIMs in the surveillance of BEpatients.

Melanoma lesions often exhibit high immunogenicity, withinfiltrating immune cells playing important roles in regression of tumorsoccurring spontaneously or caused by therapeutic treatment. Computational andexperimental methods have been used to estimate the abundance of immune cells intumors, but their applications are limited by the requirement of large gene setsor multiple antibodies. Although the prognostic role of immune cells has beenappreciated, a systematic investigation of their association with clinicalfactors, genomic features, prognosis and treatment response in melanoma is stilllacking. This study, identifies a 25-gene signature based on RNA-seq data fromThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) dataset. Thissignature was used to calculate sample-specific Leukocyte Infiltration Scores(LIS) in six independent melanoma microarray datasets and scores were found tovary substantially between different melanoma lesion sites and molecularsubtypes. For metastatic melanoma, LIS was prognostic in all datasets with highLIS being associated with good survival. The current approach provided additionalprognostic information over established clinical factors, including age, tumorstage, and gender. In addition, LIS was predictive of patient survival in stageIII melanoma, and treatment efficacy of tumor-specific antigenvaccine.Implications: This study identifies a 25-gene signature that effectivelyestimates the level of immune cell infiltration in melanoma, which provides arobust biomarker for predicting patient prognosis.

This theoretic cohort consisted of 110,000pregnant women desiring permanent sterilization at the time of cesarean deliveryand ovarian cancer prevention at an average of 35 years who were monitored for anadditional 40 years based on an average US female life expectancy of 75 years.The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years. Secondary outcomesincluded: the number of ovarian cancer cases and deaths, procedure-relatedcomplications, and unintended and ectopic pregnancies. The 1-, 2-, and 3-way andMonte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Thewillingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000.RESULTS: Both bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomywith cesarean delivery have favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In the base caseanalysis, salpingectomy was more cost-effective with an incrementalcost-effectiveness ratio of $23,189 per quality-adjusted life year compared totubal ligation. Long-acting reversible contraception after cesarean was notcost-effective (ie, dominated). Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation wereboth cost-effective over a wide range of cost and risk estimates, the incrementalcost-effectiveness ratio analysis was highly sensitive to the uncertainty aroundthe estimates of salpingectomy cancer risk reduction, risk of perioperativecomplications, and cost. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimatedthat tubal ligation had a 49% chance of being the preferred strategy oversalpingectomy. If the true salpingectomy risk of perioperative complications is>2% higher than tubal ligation or if the cancer risk reduction of salpingectomyis <52%, then tubal ligation is the preferred, more cost-effective strategy.CONCLUSION: Bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomywith cesarean delivery are both cost-effective strategies for permanentsterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction. Although salpingectomy and tuballigation are both reasonable strategies for cesarean patients seeking permanentsterilization and cancer risk reduction, threshold analyses indicate that therisks and benefits of salpingectomy with cesarean delivery need to be betterdefined before a preferred strategy can be determined.^Copyright © 2018.

As a result, patients typically present withdysphagia, regurgitation and occasionally chest pain, pulmonary complication andmalnutrition. New diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic techniques have beenrecently added to the armamentarium for treating achalasia. With the aim to offerclinicians and patients an up-to-date framework for making informed decisions onthe management of this disease, the International Society for Diseases of theEsophagus Guidelines proposed and endorsed the Esophageal Achalasia Guidelines(I-GOAL). The guidelines were prepared according the Appraisal of Guidelines forResearch and Evaluation (AGREE-REX) tool, accredited for guideline production byNICE UK. A systematic literature search was performed and the quality of evidenceand the strength of recommendations were graded according to the Grading ofRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Given therelative rarity of this disease and the paucity of high-level evidence in theliterature, this process was integrated with a three-step process of anonymousvoting on each statement (DELPHI). Only statements with an approval rate >80%were accepted in the guidelines. Fifty-one experts from 11 countries and 3representatives from patient support associations participated to thepreparations of the guidelines. These guidelines deal specifically with thefollowing achalasia issues: Diagnostic workup, Definition of the disease,Severity of presentation, Medical treatment, Botulinum Toxin injection, Pneumaticdilatation, POEM, Other endoscopic treatments, Laparoscopic myotomy, Definitionof recurrence, Follow up and risk of cancer, Management of end stage achalasia,Treatment options for failure, Achalasia in children, Achalasia secondary toChagas' disease.

This causes concerns about interval cancers, which have beenproposed to progress more rapidly. We compared outcomes of patients with intervalCRCs after sigmoidoscopy screening vs outcomes of patients with CRC who had notbeen screened.METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized sigmoidoscopyscreening trial in Norway with 98,684 participants (age 50-64 years) who wererandomly assigned to groups that were (n=20,552) or were not (n=78,126) invitedfor sigmoidoscopy screening from 1999 through 2001; participants were followedfor a median 14.8 years. We compared CRC mortality and all-cause mortalitybetween individuals who underwent screening and were diagnosed with CRC 30 daysor more after screening (interval cancer group, n=163) and individuals diagnosedwith CRC in the non-screened group (controls, n=1740). All CRCs in the controlgroup were identified when they developed symptoms (clinically detected CRCs).Analyses were stratified by cancer site. We used Cox regression to estimatehazard ratio (HRs), adjusted for age and sex.RESULTS: Over the follow-up period, 43 individuals in the interval cancer groupdied from CRC; among controls, 525 died from CRC. Colorectal cancer mortality(adjusted HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72-1.35; P=.92), rectosigmoid cancer mortality(adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.63-1.92; P=.74), and all-cause mortality (adjustedHR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.76-1.27; P=.91) did not differ significantly between theinterval cancer group and controls. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00119912CONCLUSION: In this randomized sigmoidoscopy screening trial, mortality did notdiffer significantly between individuals with interval CRCs and unscreenedpatients with clinically detected CRCs.^Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Conversely, strong inverse associations have emerged betweenphysical activity and colon cancer and possibly other gastrointestinalmalignancies. The effect of weight loss interventions - such as modifications ofdiet and/or physical activity or bariatric surgery - remains unclear in patientswho are obese and have gastrointestinal cancer, although large clinical trialsare underway. Human intervention studies have already shed light on potentialmechanisms underlying the energy balance-cancer relationship, with preclinicalmodels supporting emerging pathway effects. Central to interventions that reduceobesity or increase physical activity are pluripotent cancer-preventive effects(including reduced systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and angiogenesis,altered adipokine levels and improved insulin resistance) that directly interfacewith the hallmarks of cancer. Other mechanisms, such as DNA repair, oxidativestress and telomere length, immune function, effects on cancer stem cells and themicrobiome, could also contribute to energy balance effects on gastrointestinalcancers. Although some mechanisms are well understood (for instance, systemiceffects on inflammation and insulin signalling), other areas remain unclear. Thecurrent state of knowledge supports the need to better integrate mechanisticapproaches with preclinical and human studies to develop effective, personalizeddiet and exercise interventions to reduce the burden of obesity ongastrointestinal cancer.

Accuratepreoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucialfor treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS predictionstudies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on themagnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRIappearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurateindividualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namelybrain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-statefunctional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networkswhere the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesionappearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics featurescould capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated withprognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation withregional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks(characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamicsFC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networksfor a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on apreliminary dataset (N = 34 with bad OS, mean OS, ~400 days; N = 34 with good OS,mean OS, ~1030 days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (86.8%) onseparating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However, if usingonly conventionally derived descriptive features (e.g., age and tumorcharacteristics), the accuracy is low (63.2%). Our study highlights theimportance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatmentplanning.

Electronicaddress: kglanz@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.^Overuse of clinical preventive services increases healthcare costs and maydeprive underserved patients of necessary care. Up to 45% of cervical cancerscreening is overuse. We conducted a systematic review of correlates of overuseof cervical cancer screening and interventions to reduce overuse. The searchidentified 25 studies (20 observational; 5 intervention). Correlates varied bythe type of overuse measured (i.e., too frequent, before/after recommended age tostart or stop screening, after hysterectomy), the most common correlates ofoveruse related to patient age (n = 7), OBGYN practice or provider (n = 5),location (n = 4), and marital status (n = 4). Six observational studies reporteda decrease in overuse over time. Screening overuse decreased in all interventionstudies, which used before-after designs with no control or comparison groups.Observational studies suggest potential targets for de-escalating overuse.Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish best practices for reducingoveruse.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The penalty functions typically involve a tuning parameterthat control the complexity of the selected model. The ability of the regularizedvariable selection methods to identify the true model critically depends on thecorrect choice of the tuning parameter. In this study we develop a consistenttuning parameter selection method for regularized Cox's proportional hazardsmodel with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected byminimizing the generalized information criterion. We prove that, for any penaltythat possesses the oracle property, the proposed tuning parameter selectionmethod identifies the true model with probability approaching one as sample sizeincreases. Its finite sample performance is evaluated by simulations. Itspractical use is demonstrated in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancerdata.

Functional decline was defined as a more than10-point decrease from baseline at each time point. Resilience was defined asreturn to within 10 points of baseline. Multivariable regression was used toexamine pretreatment characteristics associated with physical function changes.RESULTS: Of 42% of participants who had physical function decline from before tothe end of chemotherapy, 47% recovered by 12 months (were resilient). Almostone-third experienced functional decline from before chemotherapy to 12 monthslater. Pretreatment fatigue was a risk factor for functional decline from beforeto the end of chemotherapy (P=.02). Risk factors for functional decline at 12months included pretreatment dyspnea (P=.007) and being unmarried (P=.01).CONCLUSION: Functional decline was common in older women receiving adjuvantchemotherapy for breast cancer in a clinical trial. Although half recovered theirphysical function, one-third had a clinically meaningful decline at 12 months.Strategies are needed to prevent functional decline in older adults receivingchemotherapy.^© 2018, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2018, The American GeriatricsSociety.

This study examined theeffect of Reimagine, an online symptom self-management curriculum that teachescoping skills, on key outcomes.METHODS: Adult breast cancer survivors with chronic pain were recruited from theArmy of Women volunteer registry for this randomized controlled trial andrandomized 1:1 to Reimagine or usual care conditions. Electronic surveyscollected demographic, clinical, and outcome data at baseline and 18 weekspost-intervention.RESULTS: Participants (N = 89) were mean age 56.7 ± 8.7 years; 67% married; 58%employed; mean years since diagnosis 8.2 ± 6.6; and 89% were in remission orcured of their breast cancer. There was a significant difference in the change indepression scores for treatment (M = - 1.7, SD = 4.5) and usual care (M = 0.3,SD = 3.8) conditions; t(85) = - 2.3, p = .03. Difference in the change in fatiguescores was significant for treatment (M = 4.8, SD = 9.0) and usual care (M = 1.2,SD = 6.6) conditions; t(87) = 2.2, p = .03. Most Reimagine users (94%) wouldrecommend the curriculum to others.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Reimagine has an effect on depression andfatigue symptoms for breast cancer survivors. Online programs can be a feasibleand effective alternative to in-person support. Additional research isrecommended with larger and more diverse samples.

Benefits of shared decisionmaking (SDM) have been described for multiple diseases, either by the use ofdecisions aids or as part of supportive care interventions.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to summarize the effects ofinterventions facilitating SDM on distress and health care utilization amongpatients with lung cancer.METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in the CINAHL, Cochrane,EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases. Studies were eligible when conducted ina population of patients with lung cancer, evaluated the effects of anintervention that facilitated SDM, and measured distress and/or health careutilization as outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, detailed in 13 publications, were included: ninerandomized trials and three retrospective cohort studies. All studies reported ona supportive care intervention facilitating SDM as part of their intervention.Eight studies described effects on distress, and eight studies measured effectson health care utilization. No effect was found in studies measuring genericdistress. Positive effects, in favor of the intervention groups, were observed instudies using anxiety-specific measures (n = 1) or depression-specific measures(n = 3). Evidence for reductions in health care utilization was found in fivestudies.CONCLUSION: Although not supported by all studies, our findings suggest thatfacilitating SDM in the context of lung cancer may lead to improved emotionaloutcomes and less aggressive therapies. Future studies, explicitly studying theeffects of SDM by using decision aids, are needed to better elucidate potentialbenefits.^Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

Safe,highly effective vaccines against HPV have been on the market since 2006, yetonly 6% of girls worldwide have received this life-saving cancer preventionintervention. International organizations, including PATH, Gavi, and thepharmaceutical companies Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, have provided support toeligible low- and middle-income countries to implement national HPV vaccinationprograms. Still, glaring disparities in the availability of national HPVvaccination programs and the coverage of the primary target population betweenthe global north and south persist. We illustrate worldwide HPV vaccineimplementation and coverage using an online data visualization, which is publiclyavailable and can be used to gain unique insights. We also present three emergingsolutions to transform future HPV vaccine delivery in low- and middle-incomecountries: low-cost generics, single-dose vaccination, and co-administration withother adolescent vaccines. By rapidly expanding access to HPV vaccination togirls everywhere, vaccine-type HPV infections can be virtually eliminated.

For ten lung cancer patients, 4D step and shoot IMRTplans were produced. The breathing cycle was divided into ten parts and for eachpart a set of CT images was acquired. For each patient the treatment plan wascopied to the CTs of each phase and subsequently recalculated. Each phase CT wasthen registered to the average intensity projection (AIP) CT using a deformableimage registration (DIR) algorithm and the composite dose distribution was thencalculated by summing up the deformed dose distributions from all the phases('4D' treatment plan). The '4D optimal' treatment plan was created by producingan optimal plan on the CTs of each phase of the respiratory cycle and summing upthe deformed dose distributions from all the phases. The results indicate that itis possible to map the dose distributions of different breathing phases in lungusing DIR, and that different DIR methods and target characteristics (motionamplitude, size, location) affect the differences between original plan, '4D' and'4D optimal' dose distributions. Although the '4D optimal' plans were designed toachieve 95% target coverage, both of the used DIR methods failed to translatethat coverage in some instances. The same variation between these methods wasalso observed in the '4D' plan comparison. This study shows that it is feasibleto perform an acceptably accurate calculation of the composite deformed dose.However, it is important to account for tumor motion and body deformationespecially when the tumor volume is small and/or located in the lower lobe of thelung.

Our study examinedwhether circulating mediators of inflammation and immune response differ by tumorEBV status. From a Latvian series of 302 gastric cancer cases, we measured plasmalevels of 92 immune-related proteins in the 28 patients with EBV-positive tumorsand 34 patients with EBV-negative tumors. Eight markers were statisticallysignificantly higher with tumor EBV positivity: chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)20 (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.6; p-trend = 0.001), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (OR =3.6; p-trend = 0.003), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; OR = 3.4; p-trend =0.004), interleukin (IL)-10 (OR = 2.4; p-trend = 0.019), CCL19 (OR = 2.3; p-trend= 0.019), CCL11 (OR = 2.2; p-trend = 0.026), IL-17A (OR = 2.0; p-trend = 0.038)and CCL8 (OR = 1.9; p-trend = 0.049). Systemic responses to EBV-positive gastriccancer are characterized by alterations in chemokines and PD-L1. Profiling ofthese molecules may enable non-invasive diagnosis of EBV status when tumor tissueis unavailable. Our findings provide theoretical justification for clinicalevaluations of immune checkpoint therapy for EBV-positive gastric cancer.

This makes it difficult to compare resultsacross randomized controlled trials (RCTs) synthesize scientific research, anduse that evidence to inform product labeling, clinical guidelines, and healthpolicy. The Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-ReportedOutcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data for Cancer Clinical Trials (SISAQOL)Consortium aims to develop guidelines and recommendations to standardize analysesof patient-reported outcome data in cancer RCTs. Methods and Results Members fromthe SISAQOL Consortium met in January 2017 to discuss relevant issues. Data fromsystematic reviews of the current state of published research in patient-reportedoutcomes in cancer RCTs indicated a lack of clear reporting of researchhypothesis and analytic strategies, and inconsistency in definitions of terms,including "missing data,""health-related quality of life," and "patient-reportedoutcome." Based on the meeting proceedings, the Consortium will focus on threekey priorities in the coming year: developing a taxonomy of research objectives,identifying appropriate statistical methods to analyze patient-reported outcomedata, and determining best practices to evaluate and deal with missing data.Conclusion The quality of the Consortium guidelines and recommendations areinformed and enhanced by the broad Consortium membership which includesregulators, patients, clinicians, and academics.

AS is caused by mutations in ubiquitin proteinligase E3A (UBE3A), which is genomically imprinted such that only the maternallyinherited copy is expressed in neurons. We previously demonstrated thattopoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors could successfully reactivate the dormantpaternal allele of Ube3a in neurons of a mouse model of AS. We also previouslyshowed that one such Top1 inhibitor, topotecan, could unsilence paternal UBE3A ininduced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with AS. Althoughtopotecan has been well-studied and is FDA-approved for cancer therapy, itslimited CNS bioavailability will likely restrict the therapeutic use of topotecanin AS. The goal of this study was to identify additional Top1 inhibitors withsimilar efficacy as topotecan, with the expectation that these could be tested inthe future for safety and CNS bioavailability to assess their potential as AStherapeutics.Methods: We tested 13 indenoisoquinoline-derived Top1 inhibitors to identifycompounds that unsilence the paternal allele of Ube3a in mouse neurons. Primarycortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice with aUbe3a-YFP fluorescent tag on the paternal allele (Ube3am+/pYFP mice) or mice thatlack the maternal Ube3a allele and hence model AS (Ube3am-/p+ mice). Neurons werecultured for 7 days, treated with drug for 72 h, and examined for paternal UBE3Aprotein expression by Western blot or fluorescence immunostaining. Dose responsesof the compounds were determined across a log range of drug treatments, andcytotoxicity was tested using a luciferase-based assay.Results: All 13 indenoisoquinoline-derived Top1 inhibitors unsilenced paternalUbe3a. Several compounds exhibited favorable paternal Ube3a unsilencingproperties, similar to topotecan, and of these, indotecan (LMP400) was the mosteffective based on estimated Emax (maximum response of unsilencing paternalUbe3a) and EC50 (half maximal effective concentration).Conclusions: We provide pharmacological profiles of indenoisoquinoline-derivedTop1 inhibitors as paternal Ube3a unsilencers. All 13 tested compounds wereeffective at unsilencing paternal Ube3a, although with variable efficacy andpotency. Indotecan (LMP400) demonstrated a better pharmacological profile ofUbe3a unsilencing compared to our previous lead compound, topotecan. Takentogether, indotecan and its structural analogues are potential AS therapeuticswhose translational potential in AS treatment should be further assessed.

Moreover, there is a lack of research investigating early-life alcoholintake as a risk factor for either overall or high-grade prostate cancer. Weexamined lifetime alcohol intake in association with prostate cancer diagnosis inan equal-access, racially diverse prostate biopsy cohort. Men undergoing prostatebiopsy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 2007 to 2018 completeda survey indicating average number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week[categorized as none (ref), 1-6, ≥7] during each decade of life. Multivariablelogistic regression was used to test the association between alcohol intakeacross decades and diagnosis of overall, low-grade [grade group (GG) 1-2] andhigh-grade prostate cancer (GG 3-5). Of 650 men ages 49-89 who underwent biopsy,325 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 238 with low-grade and 88 withhigh-grade disease. Relative to nondrinkers, men who consumed ≥7 drinks/week atages 15 to 19 had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR =3.21, P trend = 0.020), with similar findings for ages 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40to 49. Consistent with these results, men in the upper tertile of cumulativelifetime intake had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR =3.20, P trend = 0.003). In contrast, current alcohol intake was not associatedwith prostate cancer. In conclusion, among men undergoing prostate biopsy,heavier alcohol intake earlier in life and higher cumulative lifetime intake werepositively associated with high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis, while currentintake was unrelated to prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that earlier-lifealcohol intake should be explored as a potential risk factor for high-gradeprostate cancer. Cancer Prev Res; 11(10); 621-8. ©2018 AACR.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a precursorclonal state that confers increased risk of leukemia and occurs at an elevatedrate in patients with thyroid cancer relative to other solid tumors.Objective: We explore if the high prevalence of CH may be a result of RAIexposure and whether CH may be a surrogate in the association between RAI andleukemia.Design: CH, CH-potential driver (CH-PD), and overall survival were evaluated in279 patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma.Results: The prevalence of CH in patients with thyroid cancer was 37%, and thatof CH-PD was 5.2%. Age was the strongest predictor of CH and CH-PD. For everyyear increase in age, there was a 5% and 13% increase in the odds of CH andCH-PD, respectively. RAI dose was significantly associated with CH and CH-PD,even after adjustment for age, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.For every 10 mCi increase in the dose of RAI administered, there was a 2% and 4%increase in the odds of CH and CH-PD, respectively. Patients with CH-PDpreviously exposed to RAI had a significantly poorer survival, even whenstratified by age (heart rate = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.23 to 11.5, P = 0.02).Conclusions: RAI was associated with a high prevalence of CH, and CH is aprecursor state of hematologic malignancies. The implications of this study mayfavor identification of CH in patients where the risks might outweigh thebenefits of receiving RAI therapy for thyroid cancer.

We developed acomputational workflow, hervQuant, which identified more than 3,000transcriptionally active hERVs within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancerRNA-Seq database. hERV expression was associated with clinical prognosis inseveral tumor types, most significantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).We explored two mechanisms by which hERV expression may influence the tumorimmune microenvironment in ccRCC: (i) RIG-I-like signaling and (ii) retroviralantigen activation of adaptive immunity. We demonstrated the ability of hERVsignatures associated with these immune mechanisms to predict patient survival inccRCC, independent of clinical staging and molecular subtyping. We identifiedpotential tumor-specific hERV epitopes with evidence of translational activitythrough the use of a ccRCC ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) dataset, validated theirability to bind HLA in vitro, and identified the presence of MHCtetramer-positive T cells against predicted epitopes. hERV sequences identifiedthrough this screening approach were significantly more highly expressed in ccRCCtumors responsive to treatment with programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)inhibition. hervQuant provides insights into the role of hERVs within the tumorimmune microenvironment, as well as evidence that hERV expression could serve asa biomarker for patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy.

Weinvestigated whether abnormal expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) intumors is associated with local immune checkpoint activation (ICA) and responseto ICB. Twenty potentially immunogenic ERVs (πERVs) were identified in ccRCC inThe Cancer Genome Atlas data set, and tumors were stratified into 3 groups basedon their expression levels. πERV-high ccRCC tumors showed increased immuneinfiltration, checkpoint pathway upregulation, and higher CD8+ T cell fraction ininfiltrating leukocytes compared with πERV-low ccRCC tumors. Similar results wereobserved in ER+/HER2- breast, colon, and head and neck squamous cell cancers. ERVexpression correlated with expression of genes associated with histonemethylation and chromatin regulation, and πERV-high ccRCC was enriched in BAP1mutant tumors. ERV3-2 expression correlated with ICA in 11 solid cancers,including the 4 named above. In a small retrospective cohort of 24 metastaticccRCC patients treated with single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, ERV3-2 expressionin tumors was significantly higher in responders compared with nonresponders.Thus, abnormal expression of πERVs is associated with ICA in several solidcancers, including ccRCC, and ERV3-2 expression is associated with response toICB in ccRCC.

Previous studies ofnivolumab combined with ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma have excluded patientswith untreated brain metastases. We evaluated the efficacy and safety ofnivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with melanoma who had untreated brainmetastases.METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study, patients with metastaticmelanoma and at least one measurable, nonirradiated brain metastasis (tumordiameter, 0.5 to 3 cm) and no neurologic symptoms received nivolumab (1 mg perkilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for upto four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 2 weeks untilprogression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was the rate ofintracranial clinical benefit, defined as the percentage of patients who hadstable disease for at least 6 months, complete response, or partial response.RESULTS: Among 94 patients with a median follow-up of 14.0 months, the rate ofintracranial clinical benefit was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47 to 68);the rate of complete response was 26%, the rate of partial response was 30%, andthe rate of stable disease for at least 6 months was 2%. The rate of extracranialclinical benefit was 56% (95% CI, 46 to 67). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4adverse events were reported in 55% of patients, including events involving thecentral nervous system in 7%. One patient died from immune-related myocarditis.The safety profile of the regimen was similar to that reported in patients withmelanoma who do not have brain metastases.CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab had clinically meaningfulintracranial efficacy, concordant with extracranial activity, in patients withmelanoma who had untreated brain metastases.

The mechanisms by whichthese effects are mediated are currently unknown but are presumed to result fromthe inhibition of dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2). Here we show that the self-renewalof several, but not all, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines is inhibited bythioridazine. The inhibition of self-renewal by thioridazine in these cells ismediated by DRD2 inhibition. Further, we demonstrate that DRD2 promotesself-renewal in these cells via a STAT3- and IL-6-dependent mechanism. We alsoshow that thioridazine induces a G1 arrest and a loss in cell viability in alltested cell lines. However, the reduction in proliferation and cell viability isindependent of DRD2 and STAT3. Our results indicate that although there are celltypes in which DRD2 inhibition results in inhibition of STAT3 and self-renewal,the dramatic block in cancer cell proliferation across many cell lines caused bythioridazine treatment is independent of DRD2 inhibition.^© 2018 Tegowski et al.

NLR was dichotomized apreviously reported cut-off value of 3.5, while PLR and LMR were dichotomized atthe median. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated whether NLR, PLR and LMRwere predictive of OS independent of covariates including a recently developed3-item GA-derived prognostic scale consisting of (1) "limitation in walkingseveral blocks", (2) "limitation in shopping", and (3) "≥ 5% unintentional weightloss in 6 months".RESULTS: Median age was 72 years, 53% had breast cancer, 27% had stage 4 cancer,14% had Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) < 80, 11% received less intensive thanstandard treatment for stage, and 39% had NLR > 3.5. In univariable analysis,higher NLR and PLR and lower LMR were significantly associated with worse OS. NLRremained a significant predictor of OS (HR = 2.16, 95% CI; 1.10-4.25, p = .025)after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, KPS, treatment intensity, and theGA-derived prognostic scale.CONCLUSION: NLR > 3.5 is predictive of poorer OS in older adults with cancer,independent of traditional prognostic factors and the GA-derived prognosticscale.^Copyright © 2018.

However, traditionalintratumoral drug delivery system always exhibits burst release with lesstherapeutic outcomes. Here, a new self-assembling amphiphilic peptide drugconjugate (SAAPDC) is fabricated as a "two-in-one" nanofiber system comprising ahexapeptide as a matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitor and doxorubicin (DOX)for the treatment of HCC. The results indicate that doxorubicin-conjugatedpeptide (DOX-KGFRWR) self-assembles to form long nanofibers showing sustainedrelease property for inhibiting the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Thisnanofiber not only inhibits tumor growth in situ but also effectively preventspulmonary metastasis in an SMMC7721 cell line-based mouse model. In summary, thishexapeptide-based supermolecule system represents a promising nanoscale platformto sustain drug release with high loading capacity for intratumoraladministration. Moreover, the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs via drug-bearingsupramolecular MMP inhibitor nanofibers simultaneously inhibits metastasis andtumor growth to achieve synergistic effects for metastatic HCC therapy.

In a recent genotype-phenotype study, we classified 40% of KEAP1mutations as ANCHOR mutants. By immunoprecipitation, these mutants bind more NRF2than wild-type KEAP1 and ubiquitylate NRF2, but are incapable of promoting NRF2degradation. BioID-based protein interaction studies confirmed increasedabundance of NRF2 within the KEAP1 ANCHOR mutant complexes with no otherstatistically significant changes to the complexes. Discrete molecular dynamicsimulation modeling and limited proteolysis suggest that the ANCHOR mutationsstabilize residues in KEAP1 that contact NRF2. The modeling supports anintramolecular salt bridge between the R470C ANCHOR mutation and E493; mutationof the E493 residue confirmed the model, resulting in the ANCHOR phenotype.

Identifying mHAs with high allelefrequency, tight binding affinity to common HLA molecules, and narrow tissuerestriction could enhance immunotherapy against leukemia. Genotyping and HLAallele data from 101 HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) werecomputationally analyzed to predict both class I and class II mHAs likely toinduce either GVL or GVHD. Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted inHLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared withHLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater geneticdisparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted 14 of 18 previouslyidentified mHAs, with 2 minor antigen mismatches not being contained in thepatient cohort, 1 missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of thepeptide antigen, and 1 case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptideepitope derived from GRK4, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia andtestis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandemmass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK4-V were identified by tetrameranalysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPswhere the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK4-V, suggesting that thisantigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen. Computational analysisof genomic and transcriptomic data can reliably predict leukemia-associated mHAand can be used to guide targeted mHA discovery.^© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.

While tobacco andalcohol use may be less likely to cause these tumors, it remains controversialwhether differences also exist in their prognosis. Our aim is to examine the riskfactors for cancer among young (<45 years old) OTSCC patients at our institution,and to compare their recurrence and survival with older patients in a matchedcohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All OTSCC patients seen at our institution between 2000and 2015 were reviewed. Patients under 45 who with sufficient treatmentinformation were matched 1:1 on race, T-stage, and N-stage with patients 45 andolder. Three-year recurrence and survival were determined in stratified andadjusted Cox regression models.RESULTS: Of 397 OTSCC patients were seen at our institution, 117 (29%) were lessthan 45 years old. Younger patients were significantly more likely to be female,(50% vs. 39%; p = 0.04) and to abstain from tobacco (51% vs. 39%; p < 0.01).Young patients in the matched cohort were significantly more likely to have arecurrence (HR 3.9 95% CI 1.4-10.5). There was no difference in overall survival.CONCLUSION: Younger OTSCC patients in a matched cohort were more likely to recurwithin 3 years, although there was no difference in overall mortality.Differences in risk factors and recurrence between older and younger patientssuggest that some cancer among younger patients may be distinct from traditionalOTSCC.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients weretreated with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2, CbP area under the curve (AUC) 2 and C225400 mg/m2 week 1 then 250 mg/m2 for six weeks, followed by standard of carechemoradiotherapy (CRT). The primary endpoint was clinical response rate toinduction therapy as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Secondary measures includedtoxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life asmeasured by FACT-HN.RESULTS: 38 eligible subjects were treated. Primary sites were: oropharynx (OPX)(25), larynx (3) oral cavity (OC) (9), hypopharynx (1). The most common grade 3or 4 toxicity during induction was acneiform rash (26%) followed by neutropenia(16%). RR was 76.3%. Median PFS and OS have not been reached (median follow-up of3.3 years); they were superior in patients with response.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of nab-paclitaxel, CbP and C225 is feasible,tolerable and active against locally advanced SCCHN.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation (NAT) is used todownstage patients with borderline resectable tumors. The objective of this studywas to examine the postoperative morbidity and mortality of NAT afterpancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical QualityImprovement Project Targeted Pancreatectomy data, we identified patients whounderwent a PD for PDA from 2014 to 2015. Patients were grouped by receipt of NAT90 days before PD. Bivariable and multivariable analyses was used to comparepostoperative outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 3748 patients with PDA underwent PD; 926 (24.7%) receivedNAT. Those in the NAT group had more major vein resections, and longer operatingtimes (all P < 0.001). On pathologic staging, those in the NAT group had smallertumors (T1, 10.9% vs 5.1%; P < 0.001) and fewer nodes positive (N0, 49% vs 28%;P < 0.001). There were no differences in 30-day postoperative mortality oroverall complications. On multivariable analysis, patients who received NAT had alower likelihood of pancreatic fistula (OR, 0.67; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: NAT does not increase the overall postoperative morbidity ormortality of PD for PDA. There is a decreased likelihood of pancreatic fistulasin patients that receive neoadjuvant therapy.^© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We applied this technology to mouse small intestineto create 2D mouse intestinal epithelial monolayers (IEC monolayers) from geneticmouse models for functional analysis.RESULTS: IEC monolayers form epithelial colonies that proliferate on a feedercell layer and are able to maintain their genotype over long-term passage. IECmonolayers form 3D spheroids in matrigel culture and monolayers on transwellinserts making them useful for functional analyses. IEC monolayers derived fromthe Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mouse model CFTR ∆F508 fail to respond to CFTR activatorforskolin in 3D matrigel culture as measured by spheroid swelling and transwellmonolayer culture via Ussing chamber electrophysiology. Tumor IEC monolayersgenerated from the ApcMin/+ mouse intestinal cancer model grow more quickly thanwild-type (WT) IEC monolayers both on feeders and as spheroids in matrigelculture.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that generation of IEC monolayers is a usefulmodel system for growing large numbers of genotype-specific mouse intestinalepithelial cells that may be used in functional studies to examine molecularmechanisms of disease and to identify and assess novel therapeutic compounds.

Unrepaired SSBscompromise DNA replication and transcription programs, leading to genomeinstability. Unrepaired SSBs are associated with diseases such as cancer andneurodegenerative disorders. Although canonical SSB repair pathway is activatedto repair most SSBs, it remains unclear whether and how unrepaired SSBs aresensed and signaled. In this review, we propose a new concept of SSB endresection for genome integrity. We propose a four-step mechanism of SSB endresection: SSB end sensing and processing, as well as initiation, continuation,and termination of SSB end resection. We also compare different mechanisms of SSBend resection and DSB end resection in DNA repair and DNA damage response (DDR)pathways. We further discuss how SSB end resection contributes to SSB signalingand repair. We focus on the mechanism and regulation by APE2 in SSB end resectionin genome integrity. Finally, we identify areas of future study that may help usgain further mechanistic insight into the process of SSB end resection. Overall,this review provides the first comprehensive perspective on SSB end resection ingenome integrity.

Thus, the elaborate networks of fiber tracts andnon-fasciculated axons evident in mature organisms are formed via complexpathfinding. The macroscopic structures of axon projections are highlystereotyped across members of the same species, indicating precise mechanismsguide their formation. The developing axon exhibits directionally biased growthtoward or away from external guidance cues. One of the most studied guidance cuesis netrin-1, however, its presentation in vivo remains debated. Guidance cues canbe secreted to form soluble or chemotactic gradients or presented bound to cellsor the extracellular matrix to form haptotactic gradients. The growth cone, ahighly specialized dynamic structure at the end of the extending axon, detectsthese guidance cues via transmembrane receptors, such as the netrin-1 receptorsdeleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and UNC5. These receptors orchestrateremodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane through both chemical andmechanotransductive pathways, which result in traction forces generated by thecytoskeleton against the extracellular environment and translocation of thegrowth cone. Through intracellular signaling responses, netrin-1 can triggereither attraction or repulsion of the axon. Here we review the mechanisms bywhich the classical guidance cue netrin-1 regulates intracellular effectors torespond to the extracellular environment in the context of axon guidance duringdevelopment of the central nervous system and discuss recent findings thatdemonstrate the critical importance of mechanical forces in this process.

New interventions based onnovel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overallsurvival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-widescreens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitrofunctional analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independentcohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B(CALGB) 80303 and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated withOS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions ofgenetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabinetreatment were evaluated. Functional effects of common VDR variants were alsoevaluated in experimental assays in human cell lines.RESULTS: The rs2853564 variant in VDR was associated with OS in patients fromboth the Mayo Clinic (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94, p = 0.0059) and CALGB 80303 (HR0.74, 0.63-0.87, p = 0.0002). rs2853564 interacted with high pre-treatment levelsof 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a measure of endogenous vitamin D) (p = 0.0079for interaction) and with gemcitabine treatment (p = 0.024 for interaction) toconfer increased OS. rs2853564 increased transcriptional activity in luciferaseassays and reduced the binding of the IRF4 transcription factor.CONCLUSION: Our findings propose VDR as a novel determinant of survival inadvanced pancreatic cancer patients. Common functional variation in this genemight interact with endogenous vitamin D and gemcitabine treatment to determineimproved patient survival. These results support evidence for a modulatory roleof the vitamin D pathway for the survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servicesrequire an SDM visit using a decision aid as a prerequisite for LCS coverage.However, little is known about how SDM about LCS occurs in practice.Objective: To assess the quality of SDM about the initiation of LCS in clinicalpractice.Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative content analysis was performedof transcribed conversations between primary care or pulmonary care physiciansand 14 patients presumed to be eligible for LCS, recorded between April 1, 2014,and March 1, 2018, that were identified within a large database.Main Outcomes and Measures: Independent observer ratings of communicationbehaviors of physicians using the OPTION (Observing Patient Involvement inDecision Making) scale, a validated 12-item measure of SDM (total score, 0-100points, where 0 indicates no evidence of SDM and 100 indicates evidence of SDM atthe highest skill level); time spent discussing LCS during visits; and evidenceof decision aid use.Results: A total of 14 conversations about initiating LCS were identified; 9patients were women, and 5 patients were men; the mean (SD) patient age was 63.9(5.1) years; 7 patients had Medicare, and 8 patients were current smokers. Halfthe conversations were conducted by primary care physicians. The mean totalOPTION score for the 14 LCS conversations was 6 on a scale of 0 to 100 (range,0-17). None of the conversations met the minimum skill criteria for 8 of the 12SDM behaviors. Physicians universally recommended LCS. Discussion of harms (suchas false positives and their sequelae or overdiagnosis) was virtually absent. Themean total visit length of a discussion was 13:07 minutes (range, 3:48-27:09minutes). The mean time spent discussing LCS was 0:59 minute (range, 0:16-2:19minutes), or 8% of the total visit time (range, 1%-18%). There was no evidencethat decision aids or other patient education materials for LCS were used.Conclusions and Relevance: In this small sample of recorded encounters aboutinitiating LCS, the observed quality of SDM was poor and explanation of potentialharms of screening was virtually nonexistent. Time spent discussing LCS wasminimal, and there was no evidence that decision aids were used. Although thesefindings are preliminary, they raise concerns that SDM for LCS in practice may befar from what is intended by guidelines.

To evaluate the goodness-of-fit andthe correlation of those models with CBOS.METHODS: The study included 61 patients with inoperable locally recurrent headand neck cancer treated with SBRT using CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) atthe Department of Radiation Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkeybetween June 2007 and March 2011. The dose-volume histograms of the internalcarotid were exported from the plans of all the patients. The follow-up resultsregarding the end point of carotid blowout syndrome were collectedretrospectively. Initially, univariable analyses (Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-squaretests) and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed between theoutcome data and a list of clinical and treatment factors to identify significantcorrelations. Additionally, the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality(RS), and Logit NTCP models were used to fit the clinical data. The fitting ofthe different models was assessed through the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Odds Ratiomethods.RESULTS: The clinical/treatment factors that were found to have a significant orclose to significant correlations with acute CBOS were Age at the time of CK(P-value = 0.03), Maximum carotid dose (P-value = 0.06), and CK prescription dose(P-value = 0.08). Using Dmax , physical DVH, and EQD2 Gy -DVH as the dosimetricmetrics in the NTCP models, the derived LKB model parameters were: (a) D50= 45.8 Gy, m = 0.24, n = n/a; (b) D50  = 44.8 Gy, m = 0.28, n = 0.01; and (c)D50  = 115.8 Gy, m = 0.45, n = 0.01, respectively. The AUC values for thedosimetric metrics were 0.70, 0.68, and 0.61, respectively. The differences inAIC between the different models were less than 2 and ranged within ±0.9.CONCLUSION: The maximum dose to the internal carotid less than 34 Gy appears tosignificantly reduce the risk for CBOS. Age at the time of CK, Maximum carotiddose, and CK prescription dose were also found to correlate with CBOS. The valuesof the parameters of three NTCP models were determined for this endpoint. Athreshold of gEUD <34.5 Gy appears to be significantly associated with lowerrisks of CBOS.^© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Thus, tumorpurity assessment by light microscopy is used to determine sample adequacy beforesequencing and to interpret the significance of negative results and mutantallele fraction afterwards. However, pathologist estimates of tumor purity areimprecise and have limited reproducibility. With the advent of massively parallelsequencing, large amounts of molecular data can be analyzed by computationalpurity algorithms. We retrospectively compared tumor purity of 3 computationalalgorithms with neoplastic cellularity using hematoxylin and eosin lightmicroscopy to determine which was best for clinical evaluation of molecularprofiling. Data were analyzed from 881 cancer patients from a clinical trialcohort, LCCC1108 (UNCseq), whose tumors had targeted massively parallelsequencing. Concordance among algorithms was poor, and the specimens analyzed hadhigh rates of algorithm failure partially due to variable tumor purity.Computational tumor purity estimates did not add value beyond the pathologist'sestimate of neoplastic cellularity microscopy. To improve present methods, wepropose a semiquantitative, clinically applicable strategy based on mutant allelefraction and copy number changes present within a given specimen, which whencombined with the morphologic tumor purity estimate, guide the interpretation ofnext-generation sequencing results in cancer patients.This is an open-accessarticle distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible todownload and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Electronic address: smccloskey@mednet.ucla.edu.^PURPOSE: To improve assessment of symptomatic toxicity in cancer clinical trialsand complement clinician-based toxicity reporting, the US National CancerInstitute developed a measurement system called the Patient-Reported Outcomesversion of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). Theobjective of this study was to examine the content validity of PRO-CTCAE inpatients undergoing radiation therapy and to establish anatomic site-specificitem sets for implementation in cancer research.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients receiving radiation to the brain, head and neck,breast, thorax, abdomen, or pelvis were recruited during the final week ofradiation. Participants described side effects qualitatively and completedanatomic site-specific checklists indicating the presence or absence ofsymptomatic toxicities drawn from the PRO-CTCAE library. Items endorsed by ≥20%of participants were selected for inclusion. Symptomatic toxicities describedqualitatively were content analyzed and summarized. Symptomatic toxicities notreflected in the PRO-CTCAE item library were tabulated.RESULTS: We conducted 389 interviews of patients receiving radiation to the brain(n = 46), head and neck (n = 69), breast (n = 134), thorax (n = 30), abdomen (n =27), female pelvis (n = 36), or male pelvis (n = 47). Median age was 62 years;62% were female. The 53 solicited PRO-CTCAE symptoms reflected all reportedradiation-induced toxicities with the exception of phlegm/mucus production andmouth/throat pain with swallowing in patients receiving head and neck radiation,eye dryness/irritation in patients undergoing brain radiation, and obstructiveurinary symptoms in men receiving pelvic radiation. The PRO-CTCAE items "skinburns" and "pain" require greater specificity to adequately reflect toxicitiesexperienced during radiation.CONCLUSIONS: PRO-CTCAE demonstrates strong content validity as a measure ofsymptomatic toxicities in patients receiving radiation. These results provideempirical support for the definition of site-specific PRO-CTCAE item sets toassess the symptomatic toxicities of radiation therapy. The site-specificPRO-CTCAE item sets developed herein are currently being deployed in ourdepartment via an electronic platform to capture treatment-related toxicity.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic address:ronald_chen@med.unc.edu.^BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer survivors who receive androgen deprivation therapy(ADT) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. They require coordinatedcare between cancer specialist and primary care physicians (PCPs) to monitor forcancer control and manage cardiovascular risk factors.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 103 men receiving ADT with radiotherapy from 7institutions to assess cardiovascular risk factors and survivorship care. Medicalrecords, fasting labs, and patient-reported outcomes using a validated instrumentwere assessed at baseline (pre-treatment) and 1 year post-RT.RESULTS: Cardiovascular disease (39%) and risk factors (diabetes 22%,hypertension 63%, hyperlipidemia 31%) were prevalent at baseline. During thefirst year after RT completion, 63% received cardiovascular monitoring concordantwith American Heart Association guidelines. Fasting labs at 1 year showed 24%with inadequately controlled blood sugar, and 22% elevated cholesterol. Patientperceptions about care coordination were relatively low. At 1 year, 57% reportedthat their PCP "always know about the care I receive at other places," 67%reported that their cancer physician "communicated with other providers I see,"and 65% reported the cancer physician "knows the results of my visits with otherdoctors."CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer patients who receive ADT and RT are a vulnerablepopulation with prevalent baseline cardiovascular disease and risk factors, andsuboptimal survivorship care specifically related to coordinated care andcardiovascular monitoring.

Electronicaddress: Ronald_chen@med.unc.edu.^PURPOSE: Retrospective analyses of cancer registry and institutional data haveconsistently found better survival after radical prostatectomy versus radiationtherapy, which contrasts with findings from a randomized trial. This is likelybecause of the inability of retrospective studies to fully account forcomorbidity differences across treatment groups because of the lack of detaileddata in the registries. We use a unique population-based data set with detaileddata regarding comorbidities and functional limitations to assess whether thiscan provide valid comparisons of survival across prostate cancer treatmentgroups.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER)-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data set results from a linkagebetween the SEER database and the MHOS database, which includes detailedinformation regarding patient-reported comorbidity and functional limitations. Weanalyzed 3102 patients with prostate cancer in SEER-MHOS and used latent classanalysis to identify the healthiest group with minimal comorbidity burden andfunctional limitations. Among the healthiest group, we examined overall survivalacross treatments using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Three distinct health groups were identified using latent classanalysis; the healthiest group comprised 57% of the cohort and had a 10-yearoverall survival of 67%. Other health groups had higher rates of comorbidities orfunctional limitations. Among the healthiest group, 10-year overall survivaldiffered across treatment groups: no local treatment (55%), external beamradiation therapy (69%), brachytherapy (76%), and radical prostatectomy (85%).Survival curves for the 3 treated groups separated at 4 years of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the detailed health status information available inSEER-MHOS, our retrospective analysis could not fully account for patientselection biases across prostate cancer treatment groups. These findingshighlight an important limitation of retrospective studies using population-baseddata sets and serve as a reminder to interpret results with caution.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that PAR-1 enhancedDox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and cell death ofcardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The contribution of PAR-1 toDox-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated by subjecting PAR-1-/- mice andPAR-1+/+ mice to acute and chronic exposure to Dox. Heart function was measuredby echocardiography. PAR-1-/- mice exhibited significant less cardiac injury anddysfunction compared to PAR-1+/+ mice after acute and chronic Dox administration.PAR-1-/- mice had reduced levels of nitrotyrosine, apoptosis and inflammation intheir heart compared to PAR-1+/+ mice. Furthermore, inhibition of PAR-1 inwild-type mice with vorapaxar significantly reduced the acute Dox-inducedcardiotoxicity.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of PAR-1 contributes toDox-induced cardiotoxicity.

However, little isknown about Hispanic women's use of supportive medications, and whether usediffers depending on nativity (US- vs. foreign-born). This study's objectiveswere to examine patterns of supportive medication use and investigate potentialdifferences by ethnicity/nativity among women with breast cancer.METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked withMedicare claims to identify women diagnosed with incident breast cancer betweenJuly 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011. Supportive medication use (opioid pain andnon-opioid psychotropic medications) in the 90 days after diagnosis was theprimary outcome. We categorized ethnicity/nativity as US-Born non-Hispanic,US-born Hispanic, foreign-born non-Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic. ModifiedPoisson models examined associations between ethnicity/nativity and medicationuse, adjusting for tumor, treatment, and demographic characteristics.RESULTS: We included 23,091 women, of whom 88% were US-born non-Hispanics, 4%US-born Hispanics, 6% foreign-born non-Hispanics, and 2% foreign-born Hispanics.Supportive medication use varied by ethnicity/nativity. Compared to US-bornnon-Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics and non-Hispanics were 5% (95% CI0.92-0.98) and 10% (95% CI 0.85-0.96) less likely to receive supportivemedications, respectively. US-born Hispanics were 5% (95% CI 1.02-1.09) morelikely to receive supportive medications. Observed differences persisted whenanalyses were limited to stage I-III breast cancer cases.CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights potential disparities in the pharmacologictreatment of psychosocial needs of foreign-born breast cancer patients. Futurestudies should explore if differences observed here are reflective of healthdisparities or differential patient preferences.

Elevated MSI1 levelsin a variety of human cancer are associated with up-regulation of Notch/Wntsignaling. MSI1 binds to and negatively regulates translation of Numb and APC(adenomatous polyposis coli), negative regulators of Notch and Wnt signalingrespectively.METHODS: Previously, we have shown that the natural product (-)-gossypol as thefirst known small molecule inhibitor of MSI1 that down-regulates Notch/Wntsignaling and inhibits tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Using a fluorescencepolarization (FP) competition assay, we identified gossypolone (Gn) witha > 20-fold increase in Ki value compared to (-)-gossypol. We validated Gnbinding to MSI1 using surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, andcellular thermal shift assay, and tested the effects of Gn on colon cancer cellsand colon cancer DLD-1 xenografts in nude mice.RESULTS: In colon cancer cells, Gn reduced Notch/Wnt signaling and inducedapoptosis. Compared to (-)-gossypol, the same concentration of Gn is less activein all the cell assays tested. To increase Gn bioavailability, we used PEGylatedliposomes in our in vivo studies. Gn-lip via tail vein injection inhibited thegrowth of human colon cancer DLD-1 xenografts in nude mice, as compared to theuntreated control (P < 0.01, n = 10).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PEGylation improved the bioavailability of Gnas well as achieved tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of Gn, whichenhanced its overall biocompatibility and drug efficacy in vivo. This providesproof of concept for the development of Gn-lip as a molecular therapy for coloncancer with MSI1/MSI2 overexpression.

These survivaldisparities persist even when disproportionately worse tumor characteristicsamong black women are accounted. Receipt of less complete adjuvant treatmentamong black endometrial cancer patients could contribute to this disparity.OBJECTIVE: We assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancerare less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatmentwithin subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the NRG Oncology/GynecologyOncology Group 210 Study.STUDY DESIGN: Our analysis included 615 black and 4,283 white women withendometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. Women completed a questionnairethat assessed race and endometrial cancer risk factors. Tumor characteristicswere available from pathology reports and central review. We categorized women aslow-, intermediate-, or high-risk based on the European Society for MedicalOncology definition. Adjuvant treatment was documented during postoperativevisits and was categorized as no adjuvant treatment (54.3%), radiotherapy only(16.5%), chemotherapy only (15.2%), and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (14.0%).We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidenceintervals for multivariable-adjusted associations between race and adjuvanttreatment in the overall study population and stratified by tumor subtype, stage,or European Society for Medical Oncology risk category.RESULTS: Overall, black women were more likely to have received chemotherapy-only(odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.86) or radiotherapy pluschemotherapy (odds ratio=2.01, 95% confidence interval=1.54-2.62) compared towhite women in multivariable-adjusted models. No racial difference in receipt ofradiotherapy-only was observed. In tumor subtype-stratified models, black womenhad higher odds of receiving radiotherapy plus chemotherapy than white women whendiagnosed with low-grade endometrioid (odds ratio=2.04, 95% confidenceinterval=1.06-3.93) or serous tumors (odds ratio=1.81, 95% confidenceinterval=1.07-3.08). Race was not associated with adjuvant treatment among womendiagnosed with other tumor subtypes. In stage-stratified models we observed noracial differences in receipt of adjuvant treatment. In models stratified byEuropean Society for Medical Oncology risk group, black women with high-riskcancer were more likely to receive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy compared towhite women (odds ratio=1.41, 95% confidence interval=1.03-1.94).CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis we observed higher odds of specificadjuvant treatment regimens among black as compared to white women withinspecific subgroups of endometrial cancer characteristics.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

With tumors categorized by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project(mesenchymal, classical, neural, and proneural) and bymethylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, we attempted todetermine if certain genomic or molecular subtypes of GBM were specificallyassociated with IR or PSP.METHODS: Patients with GBM treated at two institutions were reviewed.Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) andprogression-free survival (PFS). Mantel-cox test determined effect of IR and PSPon OS and PFS. Fisher's exact test was utilized to correlate IR and PSP withgenomic subtypes and MGMT status.RESULTS: Eighty-two patients with GBM were reviewed. The median OS and PFS were17.9 months and 8.9 months. IR was observed in 28 (40%) and was associated withimproved OS (median 29.4 vs 14.5 months p < 0.01) and PFS (median 17.7 vs5.5 months, p < 0.01). PSP was observed in 14 (19.2%) and trended towardsimproved PFS (15.0 vs 7.7 months p = 0.08). Tumors with a proneural component hada higher rate of IR compared to those without a proneural component (IR 60% vs28%; p = 0.03). MGMT methylation was associated with IR (58% vs 24%, p = 0.032),but not PSP (34%, p = 0.10).CONCLUSION: IR is associated with improved OS and PFS. The proneural subtype andMGMT methylated tumors had higher rates of IR.

AXL and MERTK are overexpressed in head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), malignancies that are highly metastatic and lethal. AXL is themost well-characterized TAM receptor and mediates resistance to both conventionaland targeted cancer therapies. Since AXL is highly expressed in aggressive tumortypes, cancer patients are currently being enrolled in clinical trials testingAXL inhibitors. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of AXL inhibitionusing a small molecule AXL inhibitor, monoclonal antibody therapy, and siRNA inHNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models. Anti-AXL targeting strategies hadlimited efficacy across these different models which our data suggests could beattributed to upregulation of MERTK. MERTK expression was increased in cell linesand patient-derived xenografts treated with AXL inhibitors and inhibition ofMERTK sensitized HNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models to AXL inhibition.Dual targeting of AXL and MERTK led to a more potent blockade of downstreamsignaling, synergistic inhibition of tumor cell expansion in culture, and reducedtumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of MERTK in AXLinhibitor-sensitive models resulted in resistance to AXL-targeting strategies.These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies co-targeting both AXL andMERTK could be highly beneficial in a variety of tumor types where both receptorsare expressed, leading to improved survival for patients with lethalmalignancies.^Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.

These poor outcomes reflect a lack oftreatment for the most common form of lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma(NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of NSCLC, withthe main oncogenic drivers being KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). Whereas EGFR blockade has led to some success in lung ADC, effective KRASinhibition is lacking. KRAS-mutant ADCs are characterized by high levels ofgel-forming mucin expression, with the highest mucin levels corresponding toworse prognoses. Despite these well-recognized associations, little is knownabout roles for individual gel-forming mucins in ADC development causatively. Wehypothesized that MUC5AC/Muc5ac, a mucin gene known to be commonly expressed inNSCLC, is crucial in KRAS/Kras-driven lung ADC. We found that MUC5AC was asignificant determinant of poor prognosis, especially in patients withKRAS-mutant tumors. In addition, by using mice with lung ADC induced chemicallywith urethane or transgenically by mutant-Kras expression, we observedsignificantly reduced tumor development in animals lacking Muc5ac compared withcontrols. Collectively, these results provide strong support for MUC5AC as apotential therapeutic target for lung ADC, a disease with few effectivetreatments.

We show that, althoughLRP1 transcript expression is upregulated in response to both sub-lethal andlethal doses of p53-activating stress, LRP1 protein is only upregulated inresponse to sub-lethal stress. Interestingly, lethal doses of p53-activatingstress inhibit LRP1 de novo translation through an miRNA-based translationalrepression mechanism. We show that the p53-regulated miRNAs miR-103 and miR-107are significantly upregulated by lethal doses of stress, resulting in suppressionof LRP1 translation and cell death. Our results define a negative feedback loopinvolving the p53-regulated coding gene LRP1 and p53-regulated miRNA genes. Thesefindings provide mechanistic insight into the selective expression of p53 targetgenes in response to different stress intensities to elicit either cell survivalor cell death.^Copyright © 2018.

We examined multiple ESR1 fusions and foundthat two, both identified in advanced endocrine treatment-resistant disease,encoded stable and functional fusion proteins. In both examples, ESR1-e6>YAP1 andESR1-e6>PCDH11X, ESR1 exons 1-6 were fused in frame to C-terminal sequences fromthe partner gene. Functional properties include estrogen-independent growth,constitutive expression of ER target genes, and anti-estrogen resistance. Bothfusions activate a metastasis-associated transcriptional program, induce cellularmotility, and promote the development of lung metastasis. ESR1-e6>YAP1- andESR1-e6>PCDH11X-induced growth remained sensitive to a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and apatient-derived xenograft (PDX) naturally expressing the ESR1-e6>YAP1 fusion wasalso responsive. Transcriptionally active ESR1 fusions therefore trigger bothendocrine therapy resistance and metastatic progression, explaining theassociation with fatal disease progression, although CDK4/6 inhibitor treatmentis predicted to be effective.^Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Patients≥70 years with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC were randomized 1:1 tofirst-line nab-paclitaxel days 1, 8, 15 plus carboplatin day 1 of a 21-day cycle(21d) or the same nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen with a 1-week break betweencycles (21d + break; 28d). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patientswith grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) or grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression. Otherkey endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),and overall response rate (ORR). A total of 143 patients were randomized (71 to21d, 72 to 21d + break). The percentage of patients with grade ≥ 2 PN orgrade ≥ 3 myelosuppression was similar between the 21d and 21d + break arms (76.5and 77.1%; P = 0.9258). Treatment exposure was lower in the 21d arm compared withthe 21d + break arm. Median OS was 15.2 and 16.2 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72,95% CI 0.44-1.19; P = 0.1966], median PFS was 3.6 and 7.0 months (HR 0.48, 95% CI0.30-0.76; P < 0.0019), and ORR was 23.9 and 40.3% (risk ratio 1.68, 95% CI1.02-2.78; P = 0.0376) in the 21d and 21d + break arms, respectively. In summary,the 1-week break between treatment cycles significantly improved PFS and ORR butdid not significantly reduce the percentage of grade ≥ 2 PN or grade ≥ 3myelosuppression. Overall, the findings support the results of prior subsetanalyses on the safety and efficacy of first-line nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin inelderly patients with advanced NSCLC.

Here, the binding preferences of theuronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) are examined with variably-sulfatedhexasaccharides. Surprisingly, heavily sulfated oligosaccharides formed bylater-acting sulfotransferases bind more tightly to HS2ST than thosecorresponding to its natural substrate or product. Inhibition assays alsoindicate that the IC50 values correlate simply with degree of oligosaccharidesulfation. Structural analysis predicts a mode of inhibition in which 6-O-sulfategroups located on glucosamine residues present in highly-sulfatedoligosaccharides occupy the canonical binding site of the nucleotide cofactor.The unexpected finding that oligosaccharides associated with later stages in HSbiosynthesis inhibit HS2ST indicates that the enzyme must be separated temporallyand/or spatially from downstream products during biosynthesis in vivo, andhighlights a challenge for the enzymatic synthesis of lengthy HS chains in vitro.

Embryonal carcinomas (EC) and mixed testicular germ cell tumors(TGCT) containing EC, which are the most aggressive TGCT subtypes, are useful fordissecting this issue as ECs express the CD30 antigen but also contain CD30-/dimcells. We found that CD30-redirected CAR T cells (CD30.CAR T cells) exhibitantitumor activity in vitro against the human EC cell lines Tera-1, Tera-2, andNCCIT and putative EC stem cells identified by Hoechst dye staining. Cytolyticactivity of CD30.CAR T cells was complemented by their sustained proliferationand proinflammatory cytokine production. CD30.CAR T cells also demonstratedantitumor activity in an in vivo xenograft NOD/SCID/γcnull (NSG) mouse model ofmetastatic EC. We observed that CD30.CAR T cells, while targeting CD30+ EC tumorcells through the CAR (i.e., antigen-dependent targeting), also eliminatedsurrounding CD30- EC cells in an antigen-independent manner, via a cell-cellcontact-dependent Fas/FasL interaction. In addition, ectopic Fas (CD95)expression in CD30+ Fas- EC was sufficient to improve CD30.CAR T-cell antitumoractivity. Overall, these data suggest that CD30.CAR T cells might be useful as animmunotherapy for ECs. Additionally, Fas/FasL interaction between tumor cells andCAR T cells can be exploited to reduce tumor escape due to heterogeneous antigenexpression or to improve CAR T-cell antitumor activity.

Hence, the purpose ofthis paper is to provide a succinct review of the literature on the geneticfactors contributing to this variability.DESIGN: A systematic search in PUBMED was conducted to identify studies thatinvestigated the association between germline polymorphisms and disposition,clinical response and toxicities of aromatase inhibitors, as well as thoseevaluating the implications of mutations in ESR1 on clinical response.RESULTS: Polymorphisms in genes coding for phase I and phase II enzymes(pharmacokinetic genes) significantly modulated exposure to aromatase inhibitors;however, there is a paucity of data linking interindividual variability in drugexposure to clinical response. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic studies interrogatingrelationship between polymorphisms in CYP19A1 (the target site of aromataseinhibitors, i.e. a pharmacodynamic gene) and response yielded conflictingresults. Acquired mutations in ESR1 receptors have been identified as theunderlying mechanism of resistance to aromatase inhibitors, and likely predictdrug response. Although some pharmacogenetic studies have implicatedpolymorphisms in CYP19A1 and ESR1 with drug-related side effects, the putativerole of these genes in predicting toxicity warrants further validation.CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genesappear to influence aromatase inhibitor disposition, response and/or toxicity;however, prospective interventional studies are needed to understand theapplication of genomics to personalize aromatase inhibitor therapy in breastcancer patients.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Descriptive statistics were used toexamine OE accessibility and importance.RESULTS: The sample (n = 73) was 91.8% white, 5.4% African American, 1.4% Asianor Pacific Islander, and 1.4% other. The mean age was 58 (SD, 9.6) years. Outcomeexpectation importance mean was 6.1 (SD, 0.4), indicating OEs are overall"important." Accessibility mean was 4.8 (SD, 0.6), demonstrating breast cancersurvivors think about exercise OEs "sometimes/50% of the time." There was amoderate (rs = 0.48) relationship between OE importance and accessibility,indicating they are related, yet distinct.CONCLUSIONS: Outcome expectations are generally important to breast cancersurvivors. Thus, OEs may motivate increased exercise among this population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology providers should encourage patients to thinkabout OEs more often to increase exercise. Compared with traditional approachesof informing patients about exercise benefits, this may be a more comprehensiveand powerful approach to motivate exercise among breast cancer survivors.

Wereport the epidemiology of patients with cancer recorded by a de novohospital-based cancer registry at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, the soleprovider of comprehensive oncology services for half the country and location ofa high-volume pathology laboratory. Methods We conducted active case findingacross all hospital departments and the pathology laboratory from June 2014 toMarch 2016. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and HIVstatus were collected. We describe epidemiology of the cancer caseload, registrydesign, and costs associated with registry operations. Results Among 1,446registered patients, Kaposi sarcoma and cervical cancer were the most commoncancers among men and women, respectively. Burkitt lymphoma was most commoncancer among children. The current rate of pathology confirmation is 65%, a vastimprovement in the diagnostic capacity for cancer through the hospital'spathology laboratory. Among leading cancer types, an alarming proportion occurredat young ages; 50% of Kaposi sarcoma and 25% of esophageal, breast, and cervicalcancers were diagnosed among those younger than 40 years of age. A systematic,cross-sectional assessment of HIV status reveals a prevalence of 58% among adultsand 18% among children. Conclusion We report a high caseload among typicallyyoung patients and a significant burden of HIV infection among patients withcancer. In low- and middle-income countries with intermittent, sparse, ornonexistent cancer surveillance, hospital-based cancer registries can provideimportant local epidemiologic data while efforts to expand population-basedregistration continue.

In 2017, anestimated 135,420 people were diagnosed with CRC and 50,260 people died from CRC.Several screening modalities are recommended by the United States PreventiveServices Task Force (USPSTF), including annual stool tests that are usuallycompleted at home and under-used compared with colonoscopy despite stated patientpreferences for an alternative to colonoscopy. The Community Preventive ServicesTask Force recommends use of small media interventions (SMIs) to increase CRCscreening and calls for a greater understanding of its independent impact onscreening participation. This study tested whether a SMI increased the likelihoodof participant return of a USPSTF recommended Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). Intotal, 804 individuals participated in a two-group, prospective randomizedcontrolled trial. Descriptive statistics with chi-square tests compareddifferences in participant characteristics and return rates. Multivariablelog-binomial modeling estimated combined effects of patient characteristics withFIT return rates. No differences in return rates were observed overall or byparticipant characteristics other than the year of enrollment. A multivariablemodel controlling for all covariates, found gender, insurance type, and regularplace for healthcare to be significantly associated with return rates. Receipt ofthe SMI did not independently increase overall return rates but it may haveimproved the ease of completing the FIT by some participants, particularly women,those with insurance, and those with a regular place for healthcare.

We propose ageneral class of structural equation models with a semiparametric component forpotentially censored survival times. We consider nonparametric maximum likelihoodestimation and devise a combined Expectation-Maximization and Newton-Raphsonalgorithm for its implementation. We establish conditions for modelidentifiability and prove the consistency, asymptotic normality, andsemiparametric efficiency of the estimators. Finally, we demonstrate thesatisfactory performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies andprovide an application to a motivating cancer study that contains a variety ofgenomic variables.

These options are bestweighed in a process of shared decision-making with the patient's healthcareteam. Minority men experience disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, possiblydue in part to a lack of optimal communication during treatment selection.Decision aids facilitate shared decision-making, improve knowledge of treatmentoptions, may increase satisfaction with treatment choice, and likely facilitatelong-term quality of life.METHODS/DESIGN: This study will compare the effect of two evidence-based decisionaids on patient knowledge and on quality of life measured one year aftertreatment, oversampling minority men. One decision aid will be administered priorto specialist consultation, preparing patients for a treatment discussion. Theother decision aid will be administered within the consultation to facilitatetransparent, preference-sensitive, and evidence-informed deliberations. The studywill utilize a four-arm, block-randomized design to test whether each decisionaid alone (Arms 1 and 2) or in combination (Arm 3) can improve patient knowledgeand quality of life compared to usual care (Arm 4). The study, funded by theNational Cancer Institute's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), will bedeployed within select institutions that have demonstrated capacity to recruitminority populations into urologic oncology trials.DISCUSSION: Upon completion of the trial, we will have 1) tested theeffectiveness of two evidence-based decision aids in enhancing patients'knowledge of options for prostate cancer therapy and 2) estimated whetherdecision aids may improve patient quality of life one year after initialtreatment choice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03103321 .

While estimating edge directions in a DAG oftenrequires interventional data, one can estimate the skeleton of a DAG (i.e., anundirected graph formed by removing the direction of each edge in a DAG) usingobservational data. In real data analyses, the samples of the high-dimensionalvariables may be collected from a mixture of multiple populations. Eachpopulation has its own DAG while the DAGs across populations may have significantoverlap. In this article, we propose a two-step approach to jointly estimate theDAG skeletons of multiple populations while the population origin of each samplemay or may not be labeled. In particular, our method allows a probabilistic softlabel for each sample, which can be easily computed and often leads to moreaccurate skeleton estimation than hard labels. Compared with separate estimationof skeletons for each population, our method is more accurate and robust tolabeling errors. We study the estimation consistency for our method, anddemonstrate its performance using simulation studies in different settings.Finally, we apply our method to analyze gene expression data from breast cancerpatients of multiple cancer subtypes.^© 2018, The International Biometric Society.

P-glycoprotein(Pgp) contributes to multidrug resistance in numerous cancers by preventingaccumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Strategies to overcome thisresistance have been vigorously sought for over 3 decades, yet clinical solutionsdo not exist. The main reason for the failure is lack of cancer specificity ofsmall-molecule Pgp inhibitors, thus causing severe toxicity in normal tissues. Inthis study, Pgp-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed to achievesuperior cancer specificity through antibody targeting plus locoregional lightactivation. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody was chemically modified with IR700, aporphyrin photosensitizer. In vitro studies showed that theantibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drugresistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with anear infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograftmodels of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models,targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survivalof tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach producesmolecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors,and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrugresistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The rectum and mesorectum were resected using openinstruments for rectal dissection (included hybrid hand-assisted laparoscopic) orwith laparoscopic instruments under pneumoperitoneum. The 2-year DFS andrecurrence were secondary endpoints of Z6051.METHODS: The DFS and recurrence were not powered, and are being assessed forsuperiority. Recurrence was determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 6 monthsthereafter, using carcinoembryonic antigen, physical examination, computedtomography, and colonoscopy. In all, 486 patients were randomized to LAP (243) orOPEN (243), with 462 eligible for analysis (LAP = 240 and OPEN = 222). Medianfollow-up is 47.9 months.RESULTS: The 2-year DFS was LAP 79.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.4-84.9)and OPEN 83.2% (95% CI 78.3-88.3). Local and regional recurrence was 4.6% LAP and4.5% OPEN. Distant recurrence was 14.6% LAP and 16.7% OPEN.Disease-free survivalwas impacted by unsuccessful resection (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI1.21-2.91): composite of incomplete specimen (HR 1.65, 95% CI 0.85-3.18);positive circumferential resection margins (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40-3.79); positivedistal margin (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.30-3.77).CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic assisted resection of rectal cancer was not found to besignificantly different to OPEN resection of rectal cancer based on the outcomesof DFS and recurrence.

Co-mutations in the KRAS proto-oncogene and the LKB1 tumorsuppressor gene are frequent events in lung cancer that drive hypermetabolic,glycolytic tumor growth. A critical pathway regulating the growth and metabolismof these tumors is the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, whichcan be effectively targeted using selective catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitors. ThemTOR inhibitor MLN0128 suppresses glycolysis in mice bearing tumors with Kras andLkb1 co-mutations, referred to as KL mice. The therapy response in KL mice isfirst measured by 18F-FDG PET and computed tomography (CT) imaging before andafter the delivery of MLN0128. By utilizing 18F-FDG PET/CT, researchers are ableto measure dynamic changes in the glucose metabolism in genetically engineeredmouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer following a therapeutic intervention withtargeted therapies. This is followed by ex vivo autoradiography and aquantitative immunohistochemical (qIHC) analysis using morphometric software. Theuse of qIHC enables the detection and quantification of distinct changes in thebiomarker profiles following treatment as well as the characterization ofdistinct tumor pathologies. The coupling of PET imaging to quantitative histologyis an effective strategy to identify metabolic and therapeutic responses in vivoin mouse models of disease.

Soluble receptorfor glycation end products (sRAGE), which is modulated by anti-hypertensive (HT)medications, has been inversely associated with pancreatic cancer. However, theassociation between commonly used anti-HT medications and risk of pancreaticcancer is unknown. A total of 145,551 postmenopausal women from the Women HealthInitiative (WHI) Study were included in analysis. Use of angiotensin convertingenzyme inhibitors (ACEi), β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) anddiuretics was ascertained at baseline (1993⁻1998). Baseline sRAGE levels weremeasured among a subset of 2104 participants using an immunoassay. MultivariableCox proportional hazard regression model was performed to estimate hazard ratios(HRs) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer in associationwith anti-HT medications. Increased risk of pancreatic cancer was found amongusers of short-acting CCB (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.20⁻2.28) and long-term (≥3 years)users of short-acting CCB (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.42⁻3.02) compared to users ofother anti-HT medications. Average sRAGE levels were lower in short-acting CCBusers than users of other anti-HT medications (1173 versus 1454 pg/mL, p =0.038). Non-statistically significant reduced risk of pancreatic cancer was foundamong users of β-blockers (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60⁻1.07). Average sRAGE levelswere higher in β-blockers users than users of other anti-HT medications (1692versus 1454 pg/mL, p > 0.05). Future studies are warranted to confirm thesefindings and elucidate potential mechanisms by which anti-HT medicationsinfluence development of pancreatic cancer.

Data were collected through online surveys and anaccelerometer at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postintervention. Fidelity wasmeasured by questions assessing participant perceptions of MOVING ON (score ≥2)and direction of intervention effects. Feasibility was measured by recruitmentrate (target of 60 participants in 6 months), retention (total attrition <17%),and acquisition of accelerometer data (% ≥subjective exercise data obtained).Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, mixed models, and content analysis.RESULTS: Fidelity met a priori criteria (mean = 3.31, SD = 0.87). Outcomeexpectations increased 0.01 points, and weekly steps increased by 970 every4 weeks in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. All effect sizeswere small, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09. Target enrollment, achieved in 17 weeks,met a priori feasibility criteria. Retention (66%) and accelerometer dataacquisition (60%) (compared to 73% of subjective exercise data) did not.CONCLUSION: MOVING ON influenced OEs as intended and was well received byparticipants. A fully powered study, of this low-cost, easy-to-implementintervention, is warranted. Intervention and measurement strategies used inMOVING ON can be incorporated in any study targeting OEs as a mediator ofexercise or collecting exercise data with an accelerometer.^© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Incident cases of SCCHN from NorthCarolina between 2002 and 2006 (n = 1,153) were identified and age, sex, andrace-matched controls (n = 1,267) were selected from driver license records. SESmeasures included household income, educational attainment, and health insurance.Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI). Current smoking was more strongly associated withSCCHN among those households making < $20,000/year [OR 5.11 (3.61-6.61)] comparedto household incomes > $50,000/year [OR 2.47 (1.69-3.25); p interaction < 0.001].Current drinking was more strongly associated with SCCHN in household incomes< $20,000 [OR 2.91 (2.05-3.78)] compared to > $50,000/year [1.28 (0.97-1.58); pinteraction < 0.001]. Current drinkers with less than high school education orincome < $20,000 had nearly threefold odds of never-drinkers in the same SEScategory [OR 2.91 (2.05-3.78); 2.09 (1.39-2.78), respectively]. Our resultssuggest that the relationship of smoking and alcohol use may be stronger amongthose of lower SES.

Assembly ofbranched actin networks by the Arp2/3 complex is required for MT1-MMP traffic andformation of matrix-degradative invadopodia. Contrasting with thewell-established role of actin filament branching factor cortactin in invadopodiafunction during cancer cell invasion, the contribution of coronin-familydebranching factors to invadopodia-based matrix remodeling is not known. Here, weinvestigated the contribution of coronin 1C to the invasive potential of breastcancer cells. We report that expression of coronin 1C is elevated in invasivehuman breast cancers, correlates positively with MT1-MMP expression in relationwith increased metastatic risk and is a new independent prognostic factor inbreast cancer. We provide evidence that, akin to cortactin, coronin 1C isrequired for invadopodia formation and matrix degradation by breast cancer cellslines and for 3D collagen invasion by multicellular spheroids. Using intravitalimaging of orthotopic human breast tumor xenografts, we find that coronin 1Caccumulates in structures forming in association with collagen fibrils in thetumor microenvironment. Moreover, we establish the role of coronin 1C in theregulation of positioning and trafficking of MT1-MMP-positive endolysosomes.These results identify coronin 1C as a novel player of the multi-facetedmechanism responsible for invadopodia formation, MT1-MMP surface exposure andinvasiveness in breast cancer cells.

However, this treatment is not harmless and may lead to complications,with a reported incidence of systemic BCG infection ranging from 3% to 7%. Wereport a case of culture-proven Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) vertebral osteomyelitisin a 72-year-old patient with bladder carcinoma who was treated with intravesicalmitomycin C but did not receive BCG. Cultures from biopsy recovered isolateresembling Mycobacterium tuberculosis biochemically, but resistant topyrazinamide (PZA). The patient was originally started on a four-drugantituberculous regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and PZA. Aftergenotypic analysis identified the organism as M. bovis (BCG), the regimen waschanged to isoniazid and rifampin for 12 months. The patient responded well tothis treatment. This case is unique as the patient received only intravesicalmitomycin and did not receive BCG, implying the possibility of transmission fromcontaminated equipment.^© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.

Eph receptoractivation trapped EGFR in Rab5-positive early endosomes by inhibitingAkt-dependent vesicular recycling. By altering the spatial distribution of EGFRactivity, EGF-promoted Akt signaling from the plasma membrane was suppressed,thereby inhibiting cell migration. In contrast, ERK signaling from endosomal EGFRwas preserved to maintain a proliferative response to EGF stimulation. We alsofound that soluble extracellular signals engaging the G protein-coupled receptorKiss1 (Kiss1R) similarly suppressed EGFR vesicular recycling to inhibitEGF-promoted migration. Eph or Kiss1R activation also suppressed EGF-promotedmigration in Pten-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which exhibit increasedconstitutive Akt activity, and in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells,which overexpress EGFR. The cellular environment can thus generatecontext-dependent responses to EGF stimulation by modulating EGFR vesiculartrafficking dynamics.

H. Chan School of Public Health,Boston, MA, USA.^BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietarypatterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neckcancer risk when multiple populations are available.METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies(3,844 cases; 6,824 controls) participating in the International Head and NeckCancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared andstudy-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-studyfactor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined,and larynx, from logistic regression models.RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible acrossstudies (75% variance explained): the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber (OR=0.57,CI: 0.41-0.78, highest vs. lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR=0.80, CI:0.67-0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancerrisk. The Animal products and cereals (OR=1.5, CI: 1.1-2.1) and the Fats (OR=1.8,CI: 1.4-2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk,whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for theAnti-oxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additionalstudy-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We namedthem all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals and two were associated withoral and pharyngeal cancer risk.CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into patternreproducibility, and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibilityof dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk.

A positive margin wasdefined as presence of IPMN or pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.RESULTS: Five hundred two patients underwent surgery for IPMN; 330 (66%) did nothave invasive cancer on final pathology and form the study cohort. Of these, 20%harbored high grade dysplasia. A positive margin was found in 20% of cases andwas associated with multifocal disease (P = 0.02). The majority of positivemargins were associated with low grade dysplasia. At a median follow-up of 36months, 34 (10.3%) patients recurred, with 6.7% developing recurrent cysticdisease and 3.6% developing invasive cancer. On multivariate analysis, marginpositivity was not associated with recurrence of either IPMN or invasive cancer(P > 0.05). No association between margin status and development of recurrence atthe margin was found. Only 6% of recurrences developed at the resection marginand median time to recurrence was 22 months. Of note, 18% of recurrences occurred> 5 years following surgery.CONCLUSION: Margin positivity after resection for noninvasive IPMNs is primarilydue to low grade dysplasia and is not associated with developing recurrence inthe remnant pancreas or at the resection margin. Long-term surveillance isrequired for all patients, as a significant number of recurrences developed over5 years after the index operation.

Here, we genetically engineered plateletsfrom megakaryocyte (MK) progenitor cells to express the programmed cell deathprotein 1 (PD-1). The PD-1 platelet and its derived microparticle couldaccumulate within the tumor surgical wound and revert exhausted CD8+ T cells,leading to the eradication of residual tumor cells. Furthermore, when a low doseof cyclophosphamide (CP) was loaded into PD-1-expressing platelets todeplete regulatory T cells (Tregs), an increased frequency of reinvigorated CD8+lymphocyte cells was observed within the postsurgery tumor microenvironment,directly preventing tumor relapse.

Sinai,New York, New York 10029, United States.^Microbial β-glucuronidases (GUSs) cause severe gut toxicities that limit theefficacy of cancer drugs and other therapeutics. Selective inhibitors ofbacterial GUS have been shown to alleviate these side effects. Using structuraland chemical biology, mass spectrometry, and cell-based assays, we establish thatpiperazine-containing GUS inhibitors intercept the glycosyl-enzyme catalyticintermediate of these retaining glycosyl hydrolases. We demonstrate thatpiperazine-based compounds are substrate-dependent GUS inhibitors that bind tothe GUS-GlcA catalytic intermediate as a piperazine-linked glucuronide (GlcA,glucuronic acid). We confirm the GUS-dependent formation of inhibitor-glucuronideconjugates by LC-MS and show that methylated piperazine analogs displaysignificantly reduced potencies. We further demonstrate that a range of approvedpiperazine- and piperidine-containing drugs from many classes, including thosefor the treatment of depression, infection, and cancer, function by the samemechanism, and we confirm through gene editing that these compounds selectivelyinhibit GUS in living bacterial cells. Together, these data reveal a uniquemechanism of GUS inhibition and show that a range of therapeutics may impact GUSactivities in the human gut.

Hence, there is a continuing need to investigatenovel agents for the treatment and management of cancer. Antitumor activity ofgreensporone C (GC), a new resorcylic acid lactone isolated from an organicextract of a culture of a Halenospora sp. freshwater fungus, was subjected forscreening against a panel of leukemic cell lines (K562, U937, and AR320). In allthe three cell lines, cell proliferation was inhibited in dose-dependent fashion.GC further arrested the cells in SubG0 phase in dose-dependent manner. AnnexinV/PI dual staining data confirmed apoptotic death of treated K562 and U937leukemic cells. Treatment with GC suppressed constitutively phosphorylated AKTand downregulated expression of inhibitor of apoptotic proteins XIAP, cIAP-1, andcIAP-2. In summation to this, GC-treated leukemic cells upregulated proteinexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax with concomitant decrease in expressionof anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Upregulation of Bax wasassociated with cytochrome c release which was confirmed from the collapse ofmitochondrial membrane. Released cytochrome c further activated caspase cascadewhich in turn initiated apoptosis process. Anticancer activity of this isolatedfungal compound GC was potentiated via stimulating production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) along with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in K562and U937 leukemic cells. Pretreatment of these cells with N-acetyl cysteineprevented GC-induced depletion of reduced GSH level andmitochondrial-caspase-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data show that GCmodulates the apoptotic response of human leukemic cells and raises thepossibility of its use as a novel therapeutic strategy for hematologicalmalignancies.

We report recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)according to degree of pathologic response in patients treated with carboplatinplus docetaxel NAC.Experimental Design: One-hundred and ninety patients withstage I-III TNBC were treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin (AUC6) plus docetaxel(75 mg/m2) every 21 days × 6 cycles. pCR (no evidence of invasive tumor in breastand axilla) and Residual cancer burden (RCB) were evaluated. Patients werefollowed for recurrence and survival. Extent of pathologic response wasassociated with RFS and OS using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: Median age was51 years, and 52% were node-positive. pCR and RCB I rates were 55% and 13%,respectively. Five percent of pCR patients, 0% of RCB I patients, and 58% of RCBII/III patients received adjuvant anthracyclines. Three-year RFS and OS were 79%and 87%, respectively. Three-year RFS was 90% in patients with pCR and 66% inthose without pCR [HR = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.62; P =0.0001]. Three-year OS was 94% in patients with pCR and 79% in those without pCR(HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.63; P = 0.001). Patients with RCB I demonstrated3-year RFS (93%) and OS (100%) similar to those with pCR. On multivariableanalysis, higher tumor stage, node positivity, and RCB II/III were associatedwith worse RFS.Conclusions: Neoadjuvant carboplatin plus docetaxel yieldsencouraging efficacy in TNBC. Patients achieving pCR or RCB I with this regimendemonstrate excellent 3-year RFS and OS without adjuvant anthracycline.

However, institutional studies have called into questionthe generalization of these findings outside of a clinical trial.METHODS: Early-stage BC patients diagnosed in 2013, that received lumpectomy withwhole-breast irradiation, and underwent either ALND or SLND alone, in NationalCancer Database were included. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate45-month survival, accounting for demographics, comorbidities, insurance type,cancer and neighborhood characteristics.RESULTS: 62,184 patients were included, of which 21,892 (35%) underwent ALND.Patients undergoing ALND, compared to SLND, appeared to have slightly lowersurvival (91.4% vs 95.1%); moreover, even after weighting, a small differencepersisted (92.7% vs 94.7%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 0.99).CONCLUSIONS: SLND is a safe and effective alternative to ALND in BC patients withlimited nodal involvement. This study provides additional evidence that thefindings of ACOSOG Z0011 are applicable to the larger early-stage BC population.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Weinvestigated the causal relevance of TL for lung and head and neck cancers usingMendelian Randomization (MR) and mediation analyses.Methods: We developed a novel genetic instrument for TL in chromosome 5p15.33,using variants identified through deep-sequencing, that were genotyped in 2051cancer-free subjects. Next, we conducted an MR analysis of lung (16 396 cases,13 013 controls) and head and neck cancer (4415 cases, 5013 controls) using eightgenetic instruments for TL. Lastly, the 5p15.33 instrument and distinct 5p15.33lung cancer risk loci were evaluated using two-sample mediation analysis, toquantify their direct and indirect, telomere-mediated, effects.Results: The multi-allelic 5p15.33 instrument explained 1.49-2.00% of TLvariation in our data (p = 2.6 × 10-9). The MR analysis estimated that a 1000base-pair increase in TL increases risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.41,95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.65] and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.51-2.22), but not squamous lung carcinoma (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.83-1.29) orhead and neck cancers (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.70-1.05). Mediation analysis of the5p15.33 instrument indicated an absence of direct effects on lung cancer risk(OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.95-1.04). Analysis of distinct 5p15.33 susceptibilityvariants estimated that TL mediates up to 40% of the observed associations withlung cancer risk.Conclusions: Our findings support a causal role for long telomeres in lung canceraetiology, particularly for adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate that telomeremaintenance partially mediates the lung cancer susceptibility conferred by5p15.33 loci.

The short life expectancy is due in part tothe inability of the current treatment, consisting of surgical resection followedby radiation and chemotherapy, to eliminate invasive tumor foci. Treatment ofthese foci may be improved with tumoricidal human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).MSCs exhibit potent tumor tropism and can be engineered to express therapeuticproteins that kill tumor cells. Advancements in preclinical models indicate thatsurgical resection induces premature MSC loss and reduces therapeutic efficacy.Efficacy of MSC treatment can be improved by seeding MSCs on a biodegradablepoly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffold. MSC delivery into the surgical resection cavityon a PLA scaffold restores cell retention, persistence, and tumor killing. Tostudy the effects of MSC-seeded PLA implantation on GBM, an accurate preclinicalmodel is needed. Here we provide a preclinical surgical protocol for image-guidedtumor resection of GBM in immune-deficient mice followed by MSC-seeded scaffoldimplantation. MSCs are engineered with lentiviral constructs to constitutivelyexpress and secrete therapeutic TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) aswell as green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow fluorescent tracking. Similarly,the U87 tumor cells are engineered to express mCherry and firefly luciferase,providing dual fluorescent/luminescent tracking. While currently used forinvestigating stem cell mediated delivery of therapeutics, this protocol could bemodified to investigate the impact of surgical resection on other GBMinterventions.

Electronic address: sheila.santacroce@unc.edu.(2)School of Nursing, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ChapelHill, NC, United States.^PURPOSE: The study purpose was to map and identify gaps in the recent(∼2011-2017) literature on the costs of illness to parents of children diagnosedwith cancer. The costs of illness include direct costs, indirect costs andpsychosocial costs.METHODS: A systematic scoping review was conducted. Data sources included PubMed,CINAHL, PsychInfo and EconLit. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they wereconducted in high-income countries, published in the English language, andreported parent perspectives on direct costs, indirect costs and/or psychosocialcosts due to financial costs.RESULTS: 25 studies were eligible. Most were conducted in Canada, the USA, orSweden. The studies used a variety of designs, target populations, time framesand sample sizes. Intervention studies were lacking. Across studies fathers wereunderrepresented. While no study comprehensively measured costs of illness, morestudies used rigorous methods and considered psychosocial costs. Financial costswere measured using a micro-costing or general estimates approach. Psychosocialcosts were measured using a variety of PRO measures, some of which wereinvestigator developed. The studies provide evidence that financial toxicityoccurs in pediatric oncology.CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should comprehensively measure costs using aconsistent set of established measures and make efforts to recruit fathers tocost of illness research. Interventions to mitigate financial toxicity areneeded.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A preponderance of this research focuses on the Latin American case andon cancer-specific screening. This study seeks to expand knowledge of suchpreventative-health screening differences by analyzing screening rates for bloodsugar, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol among nine groups overall and (forimmigrants) at various stages of US residency. Using nationally representativedata from the National Health Interview Survey, we find that immigrants fromeight geographic regions receive preventative care at lower rates than US-bornWhites and that preventative screening is generally higher after 15 years thanduring the first 4 years of residency in the United States. Importantly, our dataalso show that screening patterns and trends vary based on region of origin andoutcome. These findings improve our understanding of immigrant health andhealth care use in the United States.

However, there are no standard dosimetric guidelines,and normal tissue tolerances for extreme hypofractionation are not well defined.We analyzed dosimetric correlations with patient-reported urinary and bowelquality of life (QOL) on a prospective trial.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancerfrom 18 institutions were enrolled on a phase 2 trial from 2007 to 2012 andtreated using robotic SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 fractions on consecutive days. Noandrogen deprivation was used. Patients received simulation with Foley catheterfor urethral delineation. The clinical target volume was prostate (low-riskpatients) or prostate plus 1 cm of proximal seminal vesicles (intermediate-riskpatients). Multiple dosimetric measures for urethra, bladder, and rectum wereprospectively recorded. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Compositewas assessed before and after treatment at protocol-specific time points. Linearregression was used to assess factors associated with QOL at 1 month and 2 years.RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were enrolled. QOL data were available for 98%,96%, and 84% at baseline, 1 month, and 2 years, respectively. Median age was69 years. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate and clinical targetvolume size were associated with 2-year urinary incontinence. There was a trendtoward worse 2-year obstruction/irritation in older patients on multivariableanalysis. Bladder and urethral doses were not associated with either 1-month or2-year urinary QOL. In contrast, rectum maximum dose was associated with both1-month and 2-year bowel QOL. At 2 years, the proportion with moderate or bigoverall bowel problems (as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer IndexComposite-26) was significantly higher in patients with rectum maximum dosegreater than versus less than the median 37.4 Gy (11% vs 2%, Fisher's exact testP = .008).CONCLUSIONS: These results provide novel data that contribute to a betterunderstanding of patient and dosimetric factors associated with adverse QOLeffects from prostate SBRT.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the association between circulatinghigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a biomarker of inflammation andstrong correlate of obesity, and the risk of three understudied obesity-relatedcancers in postmenopausal women: ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, and multiplemyeloma.METHODS: Participants were 24,205 postmenopausal women who had measurements ofbaseline serum hsCRP (mg/L) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) CVD BiomarkersCohort, a collection of four sub-studies within the WHI. Incident cancers wereidentified over 17.9 years of follow-up (n = 153 ovarian, n = 110 kidney, n = 137multiple myeloma). hsCRP was categorized into study-specific quartiles. AdjustedCox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidenceintervals (CI) for associations of baseline hsCRP with the risk of these cancers.RESULTS: There was no clear association between baseline hsCRP concentration andthe risk of ovarian cancer (quartile 4 vs. 1: HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56-1.37), kidneycancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.56-1.61), or multiple myeloma (HR 0.82, 95% CI0.52-1.29). HRs for 1 mg/L increases in hsCRP also approximated the null valuefor each cancer.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that elevated CRP is not a majorrisk factor for these obesity-related cancers (ovarian or kidney cancers, ormultiple myeloma) among postmenopausal women. Given the importance of elucidatingthe mechanisms underlying the association of obesity with cancer risk, furtheranalysis with expanded biomarkers and in larger or pooled prospective cohorts iswarranted.

Some countries haveplanned larger-scale programs, but these have either never been implemented orhave not been successfully scaled up. Most of the global burden of cervicalcancer is experienced in countries with limited resources, and mortality fromcervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women inSub-Saharan Africa.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to learn about preferences for cervicalcancer screening in Zambia, to identify barriers and facilitators for screeninguptake, and to evaluate willingness to pay for screening services to support thescaling up of cervical cancer screening programs.METHODS: We will conduct a discrete choice experiment by interviewing women andmen and asking them to choose among constructed scenarios with varyingcombinations of attributes relevant to cervical cancer screening. To inform thediscrete choice experiment, we will conduct focus groups and interviews aboutgeneral knowledge and attitudes about cervical screening, perception about theavailability of screening, stigma associated with cancer and HIV, and payment forhealth care services. For the discrete choice experiment, we will have a maximumdesign of 120 choice sets divided into 15 sets of 8 tasks each with a sample sizeof 320-400 respondents. We will use a hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedureto assess attributes at the following two levels: group and individual levels.RESULTS: The model will generate preferences for attributes to assess the mostimportant features and allow for the assessment of differences among cohorts. Wewill conduct policy simulations reflecting potential changes in the attributes ofthe screening facilities and calculate the projected changes in preference forchoosing to undergo cervical cancer screening. The findings from the discretechoice experiment will be supplemented with interviews, focus groups, and patientsurveys to ensure a comprehensive and context-based interpretation of theresults.CONCLUSIONS: Because willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening has notbeen previously assessed, this will be a unique and important contribution to theliterature. This study will take into account the high HIV prevalence inSub-Saharan Africa and prevailing gender attitudes to identify an optimal packageof interventions to reduce cervical cancer incidence. This simulation of women'sdecisions (and men's support) to undergo screening will lay the foundation forunderstanding the stated preferences and willingness to pay to help design futurescreening programs.REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR1-10.2196/10429.^©Sujha Subramanian, Yevgeniya Kaganova, Yuying Zhang, Sonja Hoover, NamakauNyambe, Leeya Pinder, Carla Chibwesha, Sharon Kapambwe, Groesbeck Parham.Originally published in JMIR Research Protocols(http://www.researchprotocols.org), 25.07.2018.

In particular, methylation of lysine 36 in histone H3 (H3K36me) hasbeen shown to mediate gene transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, andpre-mRNA splicing. Notably, mutations at or near this residue have been causallylinked to the development of several human cancers. These observations havehelped to illuminate the role of histones themselves in disease and to clarifythe mechanisms by which they acquire oncogenic properties. This perspectivefocuses on recent advances in discovery and characterization of histone H3mutations that impact H3K36 methylation. We also highlight findings that thecommon cancer-related substitution of H3K36 to methionine (H3K36M) disturbsfunctions of not only H3K36me-writing enzymes but also H3K36me-specific readers.The latter case suggests that the oncogenic effects could also be linked to theinability of readers to engage H3K36M.

Preclinical studiesdemonstrated Wnt pathway overexpression in KRAS-mutant cell lines resistant tothe MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. The combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A,a noncanonical Wnt pathway modulator, demonstrated antitumor activity in mCRCpatient-derived xenografts. To translate these results, we conducted a NCI CancerTherapy Evaluation Program-approved multicenter phase I/IB trial (NCT02188264) ofthe combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A. Patients with advanced solidmalignancies were treated with the combination of oral selumetinib andcyclosporin A in the dose escalation phase, followed by an expansion cohort ofirinotecan and oxaliplatin-refractory mCRC. The expansion cohort utilized asingle-agent selumetinib "run-in" to evaluate FZD2 biomarker upregulation andKRAS-WT and KRAS-MT stratification to identify any potential predictors ofefficacy. Twenty and 19 patients were enrolled in dose escalation and expansionphases, respectively. The most common adverse events and grade 3/4 toxicitieswere rash, hypertension, and edema. Three dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3hypertension, rash, and increased creatinine) were reported. The MTD wasselumetinib 75 mg twice daily and cyclosporin A 2 mg/kg twice daily on a 28-daycycle. KRAS stratification did not identify any differences in response betweenKRAS-WT and KRAS-MT cancers. Two partial responses, 18 stable disease, and 10progressive disease responses were observed. Combination selumetinib andcyclosporin A is well tolerated, with evidence of activity in mCRC. Futurestrategies for concept development include identifying better predictors ofefficacy and improved Wnt pathway modulation.Significance: These findingstranslate preclinical studies combining selumetinib and cyclosporin into a phaseI first-in-human clinical trial of such a combination in patients with advancedsolid malignancies.

Developing a predictive algorithmis key to optimizing HER2-targeting therapy.Experimental Design: We analyzed 137pretreatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exome sequencing from CALGB 40601, aneoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab with or withoutlapatinib in stage II to III HER2-positive breast cancer. We adopted an ElasticNet regularized regression approach that controls for covarying features withinhigh-dimensional data. First, we applied 517 known gene expression signatures todevelop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we validated on 143 samplesfrom four independent trials. Next, we performed integrative analysesincorporating clinicopathologic information with somatic mutation status, DNAcopy number alterations (CNA), and gene signatures.Results: The Elastic Net modelusing only gene signatures predicted pCR in the validation sets (AUC = 0.76).Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene signatures, clinicalfeatures, and DNA information were better pCR predictors than models containing asingle data type. Frequently selected variables from the multiplatform modelsincluded amplifications of chromosome 6p, TP53 mutation, HER2-enriched subtype,and immune signatures. Variables predicting resistance included Luminal/ER+features.Conclusions: Models using RNA only, as well as integrated RNA and DNAmodels, can predict pCR with improved accuracy over clinical variables. SomaticDNA alterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor molecular subtype (HER2E, Luminal), andthe microenvironment (immune cells) were independent predictors of response totrastuzumab and paclitaxel-based regimens. This highlights the complexity ofpredicting response in HER2-positive breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 1-13. ©2018AACR.^©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

Electronic address:ru-rong.ji@duke.edu.^Increasing evidence suggests that extracellular miRNAs may serve as biomarkers ofdiseases, but the physiological relevance of extracellular miRNA is unclear. Wefind that intradermal cheek injection of miR-711 induces TRPA1-depedent itch(scratching) without pain (wiping) in naive mice. Extracellular perfusion ofmiR-711 induces TRPA1 currents in both Trpa1-expressing heterologous cells andnative sensory neurons through the core sequence GGGACCC. Computer simulationsreveal that the core sequence binds several residues at the extracellular S5-S6loop of TRPA1, which are critical for TRPA1 activation by miR-711 but not allylisothiocyanate. Intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells induces lymphoma andchronic itch in immune-deficient mice, associated with increased serum levels ofmiR-711, secreted from cancer cells. Lymphoma-induced chronic itch is suppressedby miR-711 inhibitor and a blocking peptide that disrupts the miR-711/TRPA1interaction. Our findings demonstrated an unconventional physiological role ofextracellular naked miRNAs as itch mediators and ion channel modulators.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We used dataof patients with chronic GVHD (N = 482) from the Chronic GVHD Consortium, aprospective observational multicenter cohort. We examined the relationshipbetween self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms (measured by the Lee SymptomScale) and patients' quality of life (QOL; measured by the Functional Assessmentof Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] and the Physical Component Scale [PCS] of the36-item Short-Form Health Survey), physical functioning (measured by the HumanActivity Profile), functional status (measured by the 2-minute walk test), andoverall survival (OS). Overall, 19.3% of patients (93/481) reported beingmoderately to extremely bothered by depression, and 22.8% (110/482) reportedbeing moderately to extremely bothered by anxiety, with 14.1% (68/482) of thosereporting being bothered by both. In multivariable models adjusted for clinicalcovariates, patients with self-reported depression had worse QOL (FACT-G:β = -23.09, P < .001; PCS: β = -4.94, P < .001), physical functioning (β = -8.31,P < .001), functional status (β = -37.21, P = .025), and lower OS (hazard ratio,1.62; P = .020) compared with those with no depression symptoms. Patients whoreported anxiety also had lower QOL (FACT-G: β = -19.47, P < .001; PCS:β = -3.91, P < .001), physical functioning (β = -6.69, P < .001), and functionalstatus (β = -32.42, P = .036) but no difference in OS. Patients with chronic GVHDwho report depression or anxiety symptoms have significantly compromised QOL andphysical functioning. Self-reported depression is associated with lower OS.Patients with chronic GVHD and self-reported depression or anxiety represent ahighly vulnerable population at risk for poor clinical outcomes and substantialmorbidity from their illness.^Copyright © 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

CellularAP-1 proteins with alanine-to-serine [AP-1(A/S)] substitutions homologous toZEBRA(S186) assume some functions of EBV ZEBRA. These AP-1(A/S) mutants bindmethylated EBV DNA and activate expression of some EBV genes. Here, we compareexpression of 67 viral genes induced by ZEBRA versus expression induced byAP-1(A/S) proteins. AP-1(A/S) activated 24 genes to high levels and 15 genes tointermediate levels; activation of 28 genes by AP-1(A/S) was severely impaired.We show that AP-1(A/S) proteins are defective at stimulating viral lytic DNAreplication. The impairment of expression of many late genes compared to that ofZEBRA is likely due to the inability of AP-1(A/S) proteins to promote viral DNAreplication. However, even in the absence of detectable viral DNA replication,AP-1(A/S) proteins stimulated expression of a subgroup of late genes that encodeviral structural proteins and immune modulators. In response to ZEBRA, expressionof this subgroup of late genes was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), whichis a potent viral replication inhibitor. However, when the lytic cycle wasactivated by AP-1(A/S), PAA did not reduce expression of this subgroup of lategenes. We also provide genetic evidence, using the BMRF1 knockout bacmid, thatthese genes are true late genes in response to ZEBRA. AP-1(A/S) binds to thepromoter region of at least one of these late genes, BDLF3, encoding an immunemodulator.IMPORTANCE Mutant c-Jun and c-Fos proteins selectively activateexpression of EBV lytic genes, including a subgroup of viral late genes, in theabsence of viral DNA replication. These findings indicate that newly synthesizedviral DNA is not invariably required for viral late gene expression. While viralDNA replication may be obligatory for late gene expression driven by viraltranscription factors, it does not limit the ability of cellular transcriptionfactors to activate expression of some viral late genes. Our results show thatexpression of all late genes may not be strictly dependent on viral lytic DNAreplication. The c-Fos A151S mutation has been identified in a human cancer.c-Fos A151S in combination with wild-type c-Jun activates the EBV lytic cycle.Our data provide proof of principle that mutant cellular transcription factorscould cause aberrant regulation of viral lytic cycle gene expression and playimportant roles in EBV-associated diseases.^Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

In addition, many cellularsignaling pathways are noted to coordinate developmental processes and facilitateaspects of tumor progression. The Forkhead box superfamily of transcriptionfactors consists of a highly conserved DNA binding domain, which binds tospecific DNA sequences and play significant roles during adult tissuehomoeostasis and embryogenesis including development, differentiation,metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Interestingly,various studies have implicated the role of key Fox family members such as FOXP,FOXO, and FOXA during cancer initiation and metastases. FOXI3, a member of theForkhead family affects embryogenesis, development, and bone remodeling; however,no studies have reported a role in cancer. In this review, we summarize the roleof FOXI3 in embryogenesis and bone development and discuss its potentialinvolvement in cancer progression with a focus on the bone metastasis. Moreover,we hypothesize possible mechanisms underlying the role of FOXI3 in thedevelopment of solid tumor bone metastasis.

Carbonic anhydrasesare up-regulated in many types of cancer and play an important role in tumorprogression and metastasis. Carbonic anhydrase 9 has been implicated as apotential anti-tumorigenic target. Topiramate (TPM) is a potent inhibitor ofcarbonic anhydrase isozymes, including carbonic anhydrase 9, and has been shownto have anti-tumorigenic activity in several cancer types. Our goal was toevaluate the effect of TPM on cell proliferation and to identify possiblemechanisms by which TPM inhibits cell growth in ovarian cancer. TPM significantlyinhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and induced cell cycle G1 arrest,cellular stress and apoptosis through the AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways. TPM alsoexerted anti-metastatic effects by decreasing the adhesion and invasion ofovarian cancer cells and affecting the expression of critical regulators of theepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our findings demonstrate that TPM hasanti-tumorigenic effects in ovarian cancer and is worthy of further explorationin clinical trials.

To overcome this therapeutic hurdle, we developed aninnovative chemo-immunostrategy based on targeted delivery of mitoxantrone (MIT)and celastrol (CEL), two potent medicines screened and selected with the bestanticancer and antifibrosis potentials. Importantly, CEL worked in synergy withMIT to induce immunogenic tumor cell death. Here, we show that when effectivelyco-delivered to the tumor site at their optimal ratio by a TME-responsivenanocarrier, the 5:1 combination of MIT and CEL significantly triggeredimmunogenic tumor apoptosis and recovered tumor antigen recognition, thuseliciting overall antitumor immunity. Furthermore, the strong synergy benefittedthe host in reduced drug exposure and side effects. Collectively, thenanocarrier-mediated chemo-immunotherapy successfully remodeled fibrotic andimmunosuppressive TME, arrested cancer progression, and further inhibited tumormetastasis to major organs. The affected tumors remained dormant long afterdosing stopped, resulting in a prolonged progression-free survival and sustainedimmune surveillance of the host bearing desmoplastic melanoma.

There is a single-item pain intensity item. The PROMIS-25was translated into Chichewa and validated for use in Malawi using mixedqualitative and quantitative methods. The validity and reliability of thePROMIS-25 was assessed.RESULTS: Fifty-four pediatric patients with lymphoma completed the PROMIS-25.Structural validity was supported by interitem correlations and principalcomponent analysis. Reliability of each scale was satisfactory (rangealpha = 0.71-0.93). Known group validity testing showed that anemic children hadworse fatigue (P = 0.016) and children with poor performance status had worsemobility (P < 0.001) and pain interference (P = 0.005). Compared to children withcancer in the United States, children from Malawi reported lower levels ofmobility, higher anxiety, higher depressive symptoms, higher fatigue, bettersatisfaction with peer relationships, and higher pain interference.CONCLUSION: Translation and cultural validation of the PROMIS-25 into Chichewafor Malawi was successful. Baseline HRQoL for patients with pediatric lymphoma inMalawi is poor for all domains except peer relationships. This emphasizes anurgent need to address HRQoL among children undergoing cancer treatment in SSAusing self-reported instruments validated within the local context.^© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The software administers surveys to patients using items from thePatient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for AdverseEvents (PRO-CTCAE) through Web-based or automated telephone interfaces andfacilitates the management of survey administration and the resultant data byprofessionals (clinicians and research associates).OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to iteratively evaluate and improve theusability of the PRO-CTCAE software.METHODS: Heuristic evaluation of the software functionality was followed bysemiscripted, think-aloud protocols in two consecutive rounds of usabilitytesting among patients with cancer, clinicians, and research associates at 3cancer centers. We conducted testing with patients both in clinics and at home(remotely) for both Web-based and telephone interfaces. Furthermore, we refinedthe software between rounds and retested.RESULTS: Heuristic evaluation identified deviations from the best practicesacross 10 standardized categories, which informed initial software improvement.Subsequently, we conducted user-based testing among 169 patients and 47professionals. Software modifications between rounds addressed identified issues,including difficulty using radio buttons, absence of survey progress indicators,and login problems (for patients) as well as scheduling of patient surveys (forprofessionals). The initial System Usability Scale (SUS) score for the patientWeb-based interface was 86 and 82 (P=.22) before and after modifications,respectively, whereas the task completion score was 4.47, which improved to 4.58(P=.39) after modifications. Following modifications for professional users, theSUS scores improved from 71 to 75 (P=.47), and the mean task performance improvedsignificantly (4.40 vs 4.02; P=.001).CONCLUSIONS: Software modifications, informed by rigorous assessment, rendered ausable system, which is currently used in multiple NCI-sponsored multicentercancer clinical trials.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01031641;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01031641 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/708hTjlTl).^©Martin W Schoen, Ethan Basch, Lori L Hudson, Arlene E Chung, Tito R Mendoza,Sandra A Mitchell, Diane St. Germain, Paul Baumgartner, Laura Sit, Lauren JRogak, Marwan Shouery, Eve Shalley, Bryce B Reeve, Maria R Fawzy, Nrupen ABhavsar, Charles Cleeland, Deborah Schrag, Amylou C Dueck, Amy P Abernethy.Originally published in JMIR Human Factors (http://humanfactors.jmir.org),16.07.2018.

Inspired by the template synthesis strategy,in this work, keratin was utilized for the first time as a platform template tosynthesize metallic oxide nanoparticles, such as MnO2 (MnNPs@Keratin) and Gd2O3(GdNPs@Keratin), in a simple and environment-benign fashion. These nanoparticlespossess good colloid stability and biocompatibility, high T1 relaxivity ( r1value = 6.8 mM-1s-1 for MnNPs@Keratin and 7.8 mM-1s-1 for GdNPs@Keratin), andsuperior in vivo magnetic resonance imaging performance of tumor. Moreover, thesekeratin-templated nanoparticles have great potential as drug carriers with thecapacity of redox-responsive drug release due to the existence of disulfidecross-linking in keratin coating. These results suggest that keratin can be apromising platform template for the development of metal-based nanoparticles forcancer diagnosis and therapy.

The blood-brain barrier(BBB), which protects the normal brain, morphs into an inadequately characterizedblood-tumor barrier (BTB) when brain metastases form, and is surrounded by aneuroinflammatory response. These structures contribute to poor therapeuticefficacy by limiting drug uptake. Here, we report that experimental breast cancerbrain metastases of low- and high permeability to a dextran dye exhibit distinctmicroenvironmental gene expression patterns. Astrocytic sphingosine-1 phosphatereceptor 3 (S1P3) is upregulated in the neuroinflammatory response of the highlypermeable lesions, and is expressed in patients' brain metastases. S1P3inhibition functionally tightens the BTB in vitro and in vivo. S1P3 mediates itseffects on BTB permeability through astrocytic secretion of IL-6 and CCL2, whichrelaxes endothelial cell adhesion. Tumor cell overexpression of S1P3 mimics thispathway, enhancing IL-6 and CCL-2 production and elevating BTB permeability. Inconclusion, neuroinflammatory astrocytic S1P3 modulates BTB permeability.

Care and outcomes may improve when survivors and follow-upcare providers receive survivorship care plans (SCPs), written documentscontaining information regarding cancer diagnosis, treatment, surveillance plans,and health promotion. However, implementing SCPs is challenging. As such, wesought to identify strategies for successfully implementing SCPs.METHODS: We measured SCP implementation using performance data from cancerprograms participating in the American Society of Clinical Oncology QualityOncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led quality assessment andimprovement program. We used semistructured interviews with cancer programemployees (eg, physicians) to identify strategies for successfully implementingSCPs by comparing approaches in cancer programs that, according to QualityOncology Practice Initiative performance indicators, developed and delivered SCPsto a relatively small proportion of eligible survivors and their follow-up careproviders (ie, low performers; n = 6 participants in five programs) withapproaches among programs with better performance (ie, moderate performers; n =15 participants in nine programs).RESULTS: Ten of 14 cancer programs developed SCPs for ≥ 50% of eligiblesurvivors; two of 14 delivered SCPs to any survivors; and eight of 14 deliveredSCPs to ≥ 25% of follow-up care providers. We found that moderate performersproactively addressed SCP requirements, leveraged requirements to improvesurvivorship care, set internal targets, automated implementation, had activeleaders and champions, and tasked appropriate employees with SCP implementation.CONCLUSION: SCP implementation remains challenging. We identified strategies forsuccessfully implementing SCPs. Future research should examine how cancerprograms have achieved these strategies; findings could contribute to anunderstanding of the changes needed to implement comprehensive survivorship care.

No studies have examined mailed fecal immunochemical testing(FIT)-based outreach programs for Medicaid beneficiaries.METHODS: In a patient-level randomized controlled trial, a mailed CRC screeningreminder plus FIT, sent from an urban health department to Medicaidbeneficiaries, was compared with the same reminder without FIT. The remindergroup could request FIT. Completed FIT kits were processed by the healthdepartment laboratory. Respondents were notified of normal results by mail.Abnormal results were given via phone by a patient navigator who providedcounselling and assistance with follow-up care. The primary outcome was FITreturn.RESULTS: In all, 2144 beneficiaries at average CRC risk were identified, andthere was no evidence of screening with Medicaid claims data. To the reminder+FITgroup, 1071 were randomized, and 1073 were randomized to the reminder group; 307(28.7%) in the reminder+FIT group and 347 (32.3%) in the reminder group wereunreachable or ineligible (previous screening). The FIT return rate wassignificantly higher in the reminder+FIT group than the reminder group (21.1% vs12.3%; difference, 8.8%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7%-13.9%; P < .01). Eighteenindividuals (7.2%) who completed FIT tests had abnormal results, and 15 wereeligible for follow-up colonoscopy; 66.7% (n = 10) completed follow-upcolonoscopy.CONCLUSIONS: A health department-based, mailed FIT program targeting Medicaidbeneficiaries was feasible. Including a FIT kit resulted in greater screeningcompletion than a reminder letter alone. Further research is needed to understandthe comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions.^© 2018 American Cancer Society.

However, it is unclear if casesconsidered HER2-positive (HER2+) by the alternative probe method are similar tothose classified as HER2+ by traditional IHC and FISH criteria and benefit thesame from HER2-targeted therapies. We studied the clinical and pathologicfeatures of all 31 breast cancers classified as HER2+ by the alternative probemethod at our institution since 2013 and determined their PAM50 intrinsicmolecular subtypes. For comparison, we analyzed 19 consecutive cases that wereclassified as HER2+ by traditional FISH criteria during the same time period.Thirty (97%) cancers in the alternative probe cohort were estrogen receptor(ER)-positive (ER+), while only 9/19 (47%) of traditional HER2 controls were ER+(p = 0.0002). Sufficient tissue for intrinsic subtype analysis was available for20/31 cancers in the alternative probe cohort and 9/19 in the traditional HER2+group. None (0%) of the 20 alternative probe-positive cases were of theHER2-enriched intrinsic subtype, while 8/9 (89%) of those HER2+ by traditionalFISH criteria were HER2-enriched (p = 0.0001). These findings suggest that breastcancers classified as HER2+ only by the alternative probe method are biologicallydistinct from those classified as HER2+ by traditional criteria, and raisesquestions as to whether or not they derive the same benefit from HER2-targetedtherapies.

Althoughstudies into the cause of cancer cachexia has spanned over multiple decades,little is known about the effects of various cancer treatments themselves oncachexia. For example, chemotherapy agents induce side effects such as nausea andanorexia, but these symptoms do not fully account for the changes seen withcancer cachexia. In this study we examine the effects of chemotherapeuticcompounds, specifically, cisplatin in the colon-26 adenocarcinoma model of cancercachexia. We find that although cisplatin is able to reduce tumor burden asexpected, muscle wasting in mice nevertheless persists. Strikingly, cisplatinalone was seen to regulate muscle atrophy, which was independent of the commonlyimplicated ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, we show that cisplatin is ableto induce NF-κB activity in both mouse muscles and myotube cultures, suggestingthat an additional side effect of cancer treatment is the regulation of musclewasting that may be mediated through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

TAK1-dependent AMPK phosphorylation of Thr172 is less well characterizedthan phosphorylation of this site by LKB1 or CAMKK2. An important target of TAK1is IκB kinase (IKK), which controls the activation of the transcription factorNF-κB. We tested the hypothesis that IKK acted downstream of TAK1 to activateAMPK by phosphorylating Thr172 IKK was required for the phosphorylation of Thr172in AMPK in response to treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β or TNF-α orupon TAK1 overexpression. In addition, IKK regulated basal AMPK Thr172phosphorylation in several cancer cell types independently of TAK1, indicatingthat other modes of IKK activation could stimulate AMPK. We found that IKKdirectly phosphorylated AMPK at Thr172 independently of the tumor suppressor LKB1or energy stress. Accordingly, in LKB1-deficient cells, IKK inhibition reducedAMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in response to the mitochondrial inhibitorphenformin. This response led to enhanced apoptosis and suggests that IKKinhibition in combination with phenformin could be used clinically to treatpatients with LKB1-deficient cancers.

The success of these approaches is tied to effectiveimplementation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess theimplementation of EBAs for colorectal cancer screening and clinic-levelcorrelates of implementation in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Weconducted descriptive and cross-sectional analyses using data collected from FQHCclinics across seven states ( n = 51). A clinic representative completedelectronic surveys about clinic characteristics (e.g., size, patientcharacteristics, and medical record system characteristics) and theimplementation of Community Guide recommended EBAs (e.g., client reminders, smallmedia, and provider assessment and feedback). We used bivariate Spearmancorrelations to assess clinic-level correlates with implementation outcomes. Mostclinics were planning to implement, in the early implementation stages, orinconsistently implementing EBAs. No EBA was fully implemented by more than nine(17.6%) clinics. Clinic size variables were inversely related to implementationlevels of one-on-one education; medical record variables were directly related toimplementation levels of client and provider reminders as well as providerassessment and feedback; and rapid and timely feedback from clinic leaders wasdirectly associated with implementation levels of four out of six EBAs. Given thevarying levels of implementation, clinics need to assess current use ofimplementation strategies and improve effective program delivery to increasecolorectal cancer screening among their patients. In addition, clinics shouldalso consider how their characteristics may support or serve as a barrier toimplementation in their respective settings.

Polybromo 1(PBRM1 or BAF180) is hypothesized to function as the nucleosome-recognitionsubunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex and is frequently mutated inclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Previous studies have applied in vitromethods to explore the binding specificities of the six individual PBRM1 BDs.However, BD targeting to histones and the influence of neighboring BD onnucleosome recognition have not been well characterized. Here, using histonemicroarrays and intact nucleosomes to investigate the histone-bindingcharacteristics of the six PBRM1 BDs individually and combined, we demonstratethat BD2 and BD4 of PBRM1 mediate binding to acetylated histone peptides and tomodified recombinant and cellular nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that neighboringBDs variably modulate these chromatin interactions, with BD1 and BD5 enhancingnucleosome interactions of BD2 and BD4, respectively, whereas BD3 attenuatedthese interactions. We also found that binding pocket missense mutations in BD4observed in ccRCC disrupt PBRM1-chromatin interactions and that these mutationsin BD4, but not similar mutations in BD2, in the context of full-length PBRM1,accelerate ccRCC cell proliferation. Taken together, our biochemical andmutational analyses have identified BD4 as being critically important formaintaining proper PBRM1 function and demonstrate that BD4 mutations increaseccRCC cell growth. Because of the link between PBRM1 status and sensitivity toimmune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, these data also suggest the relevance ofBD4 as a potential clinical target.^© 2018 Slaughter et al.

However, there have been no comprehensive reports on domainrearrangements of bispecific single-chain Db (scDb) and tandem single-chain Fv(taFv), which are widely used bsAb formats. In this study, we designed allpossible domain orders for scDb and taFv (each with eight variants) withidentical Fv pairs and individually expressed all 16 variants using Escherichiacoli, Pichia pastoris, and Brevibacillus choshinensis. Comprehensiveinvestigations showed that the intrinsic functions of the variants were similarto each other, regardless of the expression host system, but expression levelsvaried depending on the format as well as on the host cell. Among the 16variants, we found a promising candidate that exhibited high activity andproductivity. Furthermore, we determined that B. choshinensis is an attractiveexpression host because of its secretory production of recombinant proteins.

We conducted a matched case-control study within theUS Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system to determine whether screening byabdominal ultrasonography (USS) and/or by measuring serum level of α-fetoprotein(AFP) was associated with decreased cancer-related mortality in patients withcirrhosis.METHODS: We defined cases (n = 238) as patients with cirrhosis who died of HCCfrom January 1, 2013 through August 31, 2015 and had been in VA care with adiagnosis of cirrhosis for at least 4 years before the diagnosis of HCC. Wematched each case to 1 control (n = 238), defined as a patient with cirrhosis whodid not die of HCC and had been in VA care for at least 4 years before the dateof the matched case's HCC diagnosis. Controls were matched to cases by year ofcirrhosis diagnosis, race and ethnicity, age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, Modelfor End-Stage Liver Disease score, and VA medical center. We identified all USSand serum AFP tests performed within 4 years before the date of HCC diagnosis incases or the equivalent index date in controls and determined by chart extraction(blinded to case or control status) whether these tests were performed forscreening.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between cases and controls in theproportions of patients who underwent screening USS (52.9% vs 54.2%), screeningmeasurement of serum AFP (74.8% vs 73.5%), screening USS or measurement of serumAFP (81.1% vs 79.4%), or screening USS and measurement of serum AFP (46.6% vs48.3%) within 4 years before the index date, with or without adjusting forpotential confounders. There also was no difference in receipt of these screeningtests within 1, 2, or 3 years before the index date.CONCLUSIONS: In a matched case-control study of the VA health care system, wefound that screening patients with cirrhosis for HCC by USS, measurement of serumAFP, either test, or both tests was not associated with decreased HCC-relatedmortality. We encourage additional case-control studies to evaluate the efficacyof screening for HCC in other health care systems, in which available records aresufficiently detailed to enable identification of the indication for USS and AFPtests.

More advanced disease predicteda higher probability of greater physical loss (OR = 1.96; 95% confidence interval[CI]: 1.14-3.36). Three factors predicted higher probability of SCP loss: taxanechemotherapy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.83), tobacco use before chemotherapy(OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.10-4.18), and SCP at baseline (OR = 1.01, 95% CI:1.004-1.015). Higher body mass index was a protective factor for functional loss(OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). A higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology GroupPerformance Status trended toward being predictive of greater probability of bothphysical loss (0.767) and functional loss (0.070), but the results were notstatistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer who wereundergoing chemotherapy had ongoing loss of muscle mass and muscle function.Advanced stage predicted physical loss. Tobacco use and taxane chemotherapypredicted functional loss. Body mass index was a protective factor for functionalloss. We identified predictors of physical and functional loss that could be usedas therapeutic targets or to guide treatment efforts.^Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.Published by Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to assess the level and nature of BC awareness in themulti-country African Breast Cancer-Disparities in Outcome (ABC-DO) cohort ofwomen newly diagnosed with BC during 2014-2017. Awareness indicators wereassessed during a baseline interview at/near diagnosis. Logistic/ordinalregression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for indicators of BC awarenessin relation to woman-level characteristics for individual settings and thenmeta-analyzed. In the 1,451 women included, almost all Namibian non-black women(n = 104) knew of BC and its curability, while in Namibian black and Zambianwomen, one in 7 (~ 15%) had not previously heard of BC and 25-40% did not know itwas curable. In Uganda and Nigeria awareness was lowest: one in four women had noBC awareness, and 2 in 3 had no knowledge of its cure potential. Low educationallevel, unskilled employment, low socioeconomic position, rural residence, olderage, being unmarried, and in some settings HIV-positivity, were associated withlower BC awareness-e.g., having unskilled employment was associated with nothaving heard of BC (summary OR 3.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17-5.23),believing that it is incurable (2.43; 1.81-3.26), and not recognizing a breastlump symptom (1.85; 1.41-2.43) but with between-setting variation (I2 > 68% forall). The findings provide evidence of the level and difference in BC awarenessand beliefs across different settings, highlighting the urgent need forcontext-specific education programmes in the SSA region.

Mechanisms that contribute to the poorantitumor immune response in PDA are not well understood. Here, we demonstratedthat cytokine IL35 is a major immunosuppressive driver in PDA and potentiatestumor growth via the suppression of endogenous antitumor T-cell responses. Thegrowth of pancreatic tumors in mice deficient for IL35 was significantly reduced.An analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed a role for IL35 in theexpansion of regulatory T cells and the suppression of CD4+ effector T cells. Wealso detected a robust increase in both the infiltration and activation ofcytotoxic CD8+ T cells, suggesting that targeting IL35 may be an effectivestrategy to convert PDA from an immunologically "cold" to "hot" tumor. AlthoughPDA is typically resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, we demonstrated robustsynergistic reduction in tumor growth when IL35 deficiency was combined withanti-PD-1 treatment. These findings provide new insight into the function of IL35in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and underscore the potentialsignificance of IL35 as a therapeutic target for use in combination immunotherapyapproaches in this deadly malignancy.

In human cancers and cell lines derived from malignant tumors, theALDH1L1 gene is commonly silenced through the promoter methylation. It wassuggested that ALDH1L1 limits proliferation capacity of the cell and thusfunctions as putative tumor suppressor. In contrast to cancer cells, mouse celllines NIH3T3 and AML12 do express the ALDH1L1 protein. In the present study, weshow that the levels of ALDH1L1 in these cell lines fluctuate throughout the cellcycle. During S-phase, ALDH1L1 is markedly down regulated at the protein level.As the cell cultures become confluent and cells experience increased contactinhibition, ALDH1L1 accumulates in the cells. In agreement with this finding,NIH3T3 cells arrested in G1/S-phase by a thymidine block completely lose theALDH1L1 protein. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevents suchloss in proliferating NIH3T3 cells, suggesting the proteasomal degradation of theALDH1L1 protein. The co-localization of ALDH1L1 with proteasomes, demonstrated byconfocal microscopy, supports this mechanism. We further show that ALDH1L1interacts with the chaperone-dependent E3 ligase CHIP, which plays a key role inthe ALDH1L1 ubiquitination and degradation. In NIH3T3 cells, silencing of CHIP bysiRNA halts, while transient expression of CHIP promotes, the ALDH1L1 loss. Thedownregulation of ALDH1L1 is associated with the accumulation of the ALDH1L1substrate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, which is required for de novo purinebiosynthesis, a key pathway activated in S-phase. Overall, our data indicate thatCHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation of ALDH1L1 facilitates cellularproliferation.

Comparisons of scores were performed between groups.RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were enrolled, of whom 103 were referred forsurgical examination. Of these, 63 were found to have histologically confirmedmalignancy. Pain levels were low throughout the study. Anxiety levels decreasedafter BLFC (∆ = -2.6), with a greater decrease among those with negativepathology results (P = 0.051). No differences in anxiety were noted based ongender, BLFC results, or test performance (true-positive/false-positive). Mostpatients found BLFC 'worthwhile' (94%), would 'do it again' (94%) and 'wouldrecommend it to others' (91%), with no differences based on BLFC results or testperformance. Most patients undergoing BLFC (76%) were willing to pay out ofpocket.CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety decreased after BLFC in patients with negative pathology,including patients with false-positive results. Most of the patients undergoingBLFC were willing to pay out of pocket, found the procedure worthwhile and wouldrecommend it to others, irrespective of whether they had a positive BLFC resultor whether this was false-positive after surgery.

This therapy has achievedimportant clinical advancement and provided a new opportunity against a varietyof cancers. However, limitations of checkpoint inhibitors application, includingthe risk of autoimmune disease, low objective response rates, and high cost,still largely affect their broad applications in patients. Therefore, it isdesirable to seek effective delivery methods to further enhance the therapeuticefficacy and reduce drawbacks of immune checkpoint blockade.

Changes in CTC number based on PSMA expression levelson CTCs were also evaluated (Epic Sciences).Results: Among the 42 patients (81% white), the median age was 66 (range, 50-85)years, and median number of doses received was 6 (range, 1-21). A PSA responsewas observed in 12 of 40 patients (30%; 95% CI, 18%-45%), measurable diseaseresponse in 6 of 19 (32% [95% CI, 15%-54%]), and CTC conversions in 13 of 26(50%; 95% CI, 32%-68%). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9(95% CI, 7.1-12.6) months. With use of the Epic Sciences non-EPCAM-based CTCdetection platform, CTCs were detected in 16 of 18 patients (89%); 11 of 18 (61%)had CTCs with PSMA expression above the analytical threshold level (PSMApositive) at baseline (range, 0.4-72.4 CTCs/mL). After treatment, PSMA-positiveCTCs were preferentially reduced. Treatment-related adverse events included grade1 or 2 fatigue (29 of 42 patients [69%]), nausea (23 [55%]), neuropathy (14[33%]), and neutropenic fever (1 [2%]).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that treatment with BIND-014 isactive and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Antitumoractivity may be related to PSMA expression levels on CTCs, which suggests thatpatients who are likely to benefit from this treatment can be identified beforetreatment is initiated.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01812746.

Robot-assisted cystectomy has been proposed to provide similaroncological outcomes with lower morbidity. We aimed to compare progression-freesurvival in patients with bladder cancer treated with open cystectomy androbot-assisted cystectomy.METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged ≥18years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer orrefractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominalor pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that wouldpreclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded.Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with blockrandomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical Tstage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receiverobot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporealurinary diversion. Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists. Theprimary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival, with non-inferiorityestablished if the lower bound of the one-sided 97·5% CI for the treatmentdifference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -15percentage points. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population.Safety was assessed in the same population. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01157676.FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 18, 2014, 350 participants were randomlyassigned to treatment. The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in 176patients and open cystectomy in 174 patients. 17 (10%) of 176 patients in therobotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (5%) patients had adifferent surgery to that they were assigned. 21 (12%) of 174 patients in theopen cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (1%) patient had roboticcystectomy instead of open cystectomy. Thus, 302 patients (150 in the roboticcystectomy group and 152 in the open cystectomy group) were included in theper-protocol analysis set. 2-year progression-free survival was 72·3% (95% CI64·3 to 78·8) in the robotic cystectomy group and 71·6% (95% CI 63·6 to 78·2) inthe open cystectomy group (difference 0·7%, 95% CI -9·6% to 10·9%;pnon-inferiority=0·001), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy.Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomygroup and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group. The most commonadverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomygroup vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%]in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group).INTERPRETATION: In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy wasnon-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival. Increasedadoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomisedtrials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with othercancer types.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of genes whose expression in primary tumors isassociated with these key tumor/patient characteristics can shed light onmolecular mechanisms of melanoma survival. Here, we show results from a geneexpression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary melanomas withextensive clinical annotation. The Cancer Genome Atlas data on primary melanomaswere used for validation of nominally significant associations. We identifiedfive genes that were significantly associated with the presence oftumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the joint analysis after adjustment formultiple testing: IL1R2, PPL, PLA2G3, RASAL1, and SGK2. We also identified twogenes significantly associated with melanoma metastasis to the regional lymphnodes (PIK3CG and IL2RA), and two genes significantly associated with sex (KDM5Cand KDM6A). We found that LEF1 was significantly associated with Breslowthickness and CCNA2 and UBE2T with mitosis. RAD50 was the gene most significantlyassociated with survival, with a higher level of expression associated with worsesurvival.

Since APC/C promotes the degradation ofmitotic cyclins, it controls cell cycle-dependent oscillations incyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Both CDKs and APC/C control a largenumber of substrates and are regulated by analogous mechanisms, includingcofactor-dependent activation. However, whereas substrate dephosphorylation isknown to counteract CDK, it remains largely unknown whether deubiquitinatingenzymes (DUBs) antagonize APC/C substrate ubiquitination during mitosis. Here, wedemonstrate that Cezanne/OTUD7B is a cell cycle-regulated DUB that opposes theubiquitination of APC/C targets. Cezanne is remarkably specific for K11-linkedubiquitin chains, which are formed by APC/C in mitosis. Accordingly, Cezannebinds established APC/C substrates and reverses their APC/C-mediatedubiquitination. Cezanne depletion accelerates APC/C substrate degradation andcauses errors in mitotic progression and formation of micronuclei. These datahighlight the importance of tempered APC/C substrate destruction in maintainingchromosome stability. Furthermore, Cezanne is recurrently amplified andoverexpressed in numerous malignancies, suggesting a potential role in genomemaintenance and cancer cell proliferation.^© 2018 The Authors.

Declan.Walsh@carolinashealthcare.org.(9)School of Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.^Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating cancer symptoms, and isassociated with impaired quality of life. The exact pathophysiology ofcancer-related fatigue (CRF) is poorly understood, but in any individual, it islikely multifactorial and involves inter-related cytokine, muscular,neurotransmitter, and neuroendocrine changes. Underlying CRF mechanisms proposedinclude central and peripheral hypotheses. Central mechanisms include hypothesesabout cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis disruption,circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin, and vagal afferent nerve function whileperipheral mechanisms include hypotheses about adenosine triphosphate and musclecontractile properties. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidencefrom other conditions in which fatigue is characteristic. The purpose of thisarticle is to provide a narrative review of the literature and present thecurrent controversies in the pathophysiology of CRF, particularly in relation tocentral and peripheral hypotheses for CRF. An understanding of pathophysiologymay facilitate direct and simple therapeutic interventions for those with cancer.

By demonstrating that minimally invasive hysterectomycontinues to have superior outcomes even with increased uterine weights,opportunity exists to meaningfully decrease morbidity, mortality, and costassociated with abdominal hysterectomy.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if there is an association between uterineweight and posthysterectomy complications and if differences in that associationexist across vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal approaches.STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cohort study of prospectively collected qualityimprovement data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical QualityImprovement Program database, composed of patient information and 30-daypostoperative outcomes from >500 hospitals across the United States and targeteddata files, which includes additional data on procedure-specific risk factors andoutcomes in >100 of those participating hospitals. We analyzed patientsundergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions from 2014 through 2015, identifiedby Current Procedural Terminology code. We excluded patients who had cancer,surgery by a nongynecology specialty, or missing uterine weight. Patients werecompared with respect to 30-day postoperative complications and uterine weight,stratified by surgical approach. Bivariable tests and multivariable logisticregression were used for analysis.RESULTS: In all, 27,167 patients were analyzed. After adjusting for potentialconfounders, including medical and surgical variables, women with 500-g uteriwere >30% more likely to have complications compared to women with uteri ≤100 g(adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.54; P < .0001), womenwith 750-g uteri were nearly 60% as likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95%confidence interval, 1.37-1.82; P < .0001), and women with uteri ≥1000 g were>80% more likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.21;P < .0001). The incidence of 30-day postsurgical complications was nearly doublein the abdominal hysterectomy group (15%) compared to the laparoscopic group(8%). Additionally, for each stratum of uterine weight, abdominal hysterectomyhad significantly higher odds of any complication compared to laparoscopichysterectomy, even after adjusting for potential demographic, medical, andsurgical confounders. For uteri <250 g, abdominal hysterectomy had twice the oddsof any complication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio,2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-2.33), and among women with uteri between250-500 g, abdominal hysterectomy was associated with an almost 80% increase inodds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval,1.41-2.19). Even among women with uteri >500 g, abdominal hysterectomy was stillassociated with a >30% increased odds of any complication, compared tolaparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval,1.07-1.71).CONCLUSION: We found that while uterine weight was an independent risk factor forposthysterectomy complications, abdominal hysterectomy had higher odds of anycomplication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, even for markedly enlargeduteri. Our study suggests that uterine weight alone is not an appropriateindication for abdominal hysterectomy. We also identified that it is safe toperform larger hysterectomies laparoscopically. Patients may benefit fromreferral to experienced surgeons who are able to offer laparoscopic hysterectomyeven for markedly enlarged uteri.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Inthe 2011 American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there wereclose to 1.8 million Arab Americans living within the United States, a 47%increase in population size from 2000. According to the Arab American Institute,currently, that estimate has grown to approximately 3.7 million. They have highrates of smoking and low rates of smoking cessation. In this study, theresearchers investigated factors influencing desire to quit smoking among ArabAmericans, and their association with acculturation and health beliefs.METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional descriptive study investigating smoking behaviorsand factors influencing the desire to quit smoking among adult Arab American.Data were collected to measure tobacco use, nicotine dependence, desire to quitsmoking, acculturation, and health beliefs.RESULTS: The sample ( N = 96) was 55% female, mean age of 44 years (±14.79). Thedesire to quit smoking was positively associated with perceived severity (p <.05) and susceptibility to cancer (p < .05), perceived benefits of quittingsmoking ( p < .01); and negatively associated with smoking barriers (addictionbarriers p < .05, external barriers p = .27, internal barriers p < .05), andnicotine dependence (p < .05). Being female, having a lower level of nicotinedependence, and a higher perception of cancer severity predicted higher desire toquit smoking ( p < .01).DISCUSSION: Smoking cessation intervention studies need to target appropriatehealth beliefs, especially the high risk of cancer caused by smoking among ArabAmericans.

In this analysis, wecomprehensively evaluated characteristics associated with higher suicide ratesamong patients with cancers of the digestive system.METHODS: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsdatabase, we identified all patients diagnosed with digestive system cancersduring 2000 to 2014. Patients were classified as having died of suicide if theircause of death in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results was listed as"suicide and self-inflicted injury." Suicide rates were compared to age-, sex-,and race-adjusted rates in the general population.RESULTS: A total of 881 suicides were identified among 856 293 patients diagnosedwith digestive system cancers. The suicide rate in this population was 32.8 per100 000 person-years and was nearly twice that in the general population(standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.79-2.04). Suicide rateswere significantly elevated for all cancer sites but were highest for esophageal(SMR = 5.03), pancreatic (SMR = 5.28), stomach (SMR = 2.84), and liver(SMR = 2.14) cancers. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide were highestwithin the first 5 years of diagnosis and increased with age at diagnosis for allsites except colon and stomach.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancers of the digestive system have a higherincidence of suicide than the general population. Suicide rates among esophagealand pancreatic cancer patients are more than 5 times general population rates.The involvement of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may be acritical component of cancer care for these high-risk patient subgroups.^© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While associations between serumcreatine kinase (CK) elevations and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for thetreatment of solid malignancies have been previously reported, we report a caseof cabozantinib-associated CK elevation that was associated with musculoskeletalcomplaints by an RCC patient. Nine days following initiation of cabozantinib, thepatient reported muscle cramps and serum CK had increased from levels 12 monthsearlier that were within normal limits to a grade 1 elevation of 244 units/L.Despite a dose reduction, her CK continued to rise over the next 2 months,leading to a peak CK of 914 units/L. Due to this grade 3 elevation, cabozantinibwas permanently discontinued, and her CK subsequently returned to a grade 1elevation within one week and then to baseline within 3 weeks. The temporalrelationship between drug exposure and CK increase strongly suggests causality.To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of CK elevationattributed to cabozantinib, but cabozantinib-induced CK elevations could beunder-reported, and providers should monitor for musculoskeletal complaintsduring cabozantinib therapy.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a primaryclinical means of TP53 mutation determination, only detects mutations thatfacilitate protein accumulation (e.g., missense mutations). RNA-based pathwaymethods capture functional status and may aid in understanding the role of TP53function in racial disparities of breast cancer. TP53 status was assessed amonginvasive breast cancer cases from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS)(2008-2013) using IHC and an established RNA-based TP53 signature (CBCS and TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)). Frequency of TP53 status (IHC, RNA-based) wasestimated in association with tumor characteristics, PAM50 intrinsic subtype,age, and race using relative frequency differences (RFDs) and 95% confidenceintervals (95% CI) as the measure of association. Approximately 60% of basal-liketumors were TP53 protein positive (IHC), while nearly 100% were TP53 mutant-like(RNA). Luminal A tumors had low frequency of TP53 positivity (IHC: 7.9%) andmutant-like status (RNA: 1.7%). Mutant-like TP53 (RNA) was strongly associatedwith age ≤50 years, high tumor grade, advanced stage of disease, large tumorsize, and basal-like and HER2 intrinsic subtypes. Black race was stronglyassociated with TP53 mutant-like status (RNA) (RFD: 24.8%, 95% CI: 20.5, 29.0)even after adjusting for age, grade, stage (RFD: 11.3%; 95% CI: 7.6, 15.0).Associations were attenuated and non-significant when measured by IHC. IHC-basedTP53 status is an insensitive measurement of TP53 functional status. RNA-basedmethods suggest a role for TP53 in tumor prognostic features and racialdisparities.

We sought to understand SCP implementation in cancer programs in the USAwith the objective of identifying opportunities for improvement. We recruitedcancer care providers in the USA via several cancer care networks to participatein a survey regarding SCP implementation. We used descriptive statistics toanalyze the data. Three hundred ninety-five providers from diverse cancerprograms in 47 states and Washington, DC responded to the survey. The timing ofSCP implementation varied across and within cancer programs, with approximately40% of respondents reporting developing SCPs more than 3 months after primarytreatment or adjuvant therapy completion. Nurse navigators were responsible for48-58% of each stage of SCP implementation. Processes that could have beenautomated often occurred in-person or via phone and vice versa. Respondentsreported spending more than 2 h per SCP to complete all stages of implementation,of which less than a third was reimbursed by third-party payers. We identifiedseveral opportunities for improving SCP implementation, including broadening thebase of responsibility, optimizing modes of communication, decreasing the timerequired and increasing the funding available, and limiting variation in SCPimplementation across and within cancer programs. Future work should assess theinfluence of approaches to SCP implementation on desired outcomes.

When we stratified these data by H. pyloristatus, there was no change in the association.CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex serology of the aforementioned EBV antigens in serum maynot be a suitable biomarker for predicting gastric cancer risk in East Asianpopulations.

However, self-monitoring behaviors vary over time, increasing risk ofweight gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW and DATwith corresponding weight fluctuations among African American breast cancersurvivors.METHODS: Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial, we conducted asecondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW group (n = 13) and aDSW+DAT group (n = 11). DSW and DAT were captured from wireless scale andactivity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW was defined as one or more dayswithout a weight measurement, and nonadherence to DAT was defined as one or moredays without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used toexamine weight fluctuations in relation to nonadherence to DSW and DAT. Dataanalysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017.RESULTS: Over the 6-month study period, women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weightmeasurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence toDSW was associated with weight fluctuations. For every 1-day increase innonadherence to DSW, weight increased by 0.031 kg (95% CI: 0.012, 0.050; p<0.01).Additionally, during periods of DSW and DAT weight decreased by 0.028 kg (95% CI:-0.042, -0.014; p<0.001) and 0.017 kg (95% CI: -0.030; -0.004) respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW was associated withweight gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight loss was enhanced duringperiods of DSW and DAT.

As part of a larger studyto evaluate whether providing standardized symptom reports to the medical teamwould decrease the time to treatment of reported symptoms in hematopoieticstem-cell transplant recipients, we assessed nurses' and providers' perceptionsof electronic symptom reporting.METHODS: Semistructured interviews of RNs, MDs, NPs and PAs were conducted at anacademic cancer center in the southeastern United States. Nurses' and providers'perceptions of electronic symptom reporting were explored. Interviews wereaudio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by two investigators to identify majorthemes.RESULTS: Fourteen RNs and seven providers (MDs, PAs, and NPs) participated in theinterviews. Three main themes emerged from the interviews: electronic symptomreporting may improve assessment and care, integrating symptom reporting intonurse workflow presents difficulties, and there are barriers for completion ofsurveys.CONCLUSION: The majority of nurses and providers believed that the inclusion ofelectronic symptom reporting in bone marrow transplantation inpatient units hasthe potential to improve care but that barriers to implementation remain.

Our methodology provides a conceptually appealing andcomputationally feasible framework that allows one to construct a fixed,maximally informative prior a priori while simultaneously identifying the minimumsample size required for the new trial so that the design has high power andreasonable type I error control from a Bayesian perspective. This strategy isparticularly well suited for scenarios where adaptive borrowing approaches arenot practical due to the nature of the trial, complexity of the model, or thesource of the prior information. Control of a Bayesian type I error rate offers asensible balance between wanting to use high-quality information in the designand analysis of future trials while still controlling type I errors in anequitable way. Moreover, sample size determination based on our Bayesian view ofpower can lead to a more adequately sized trial by virtue of taking into accountall the uncertainty in the treatment effect. We demonstrate our methodology bydesigning a cancer clinical trial in high-risk melanoma.^© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This phase II studyevaluated everolimus (E), a brain-permeable mTOR inhibitor, trastuzumab (T), andvinorelbine (V) in patients with HER2 + BCBM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had progressive HER2 + BCBM. The primaryendpoint was intracranial response rate (RR); secondary objectives were CNSclinical benefit rate (CBR), extracranial RR, time to progression (TTP), overallsurvival (OS), and targeted sequencing of tumors from enrolled patients. Atwo-stage design distinguished intracranial RR of 5% versus 20%.RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity, 26 for efficacy. IntracranialRR was 4% (1 PR). CNS CBR at 6 mos was 27%; at 3 mos 65%. Median intracranial TTPwas 3.9 mos (95% CI 2.2-5). OS was 12.2 mos (95% CI 0.6-20.2). Grade 3-4toxicities included neutropenia (41%), anemia (16%), and stomatitis (16%).Mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were common in BCBM. Mutations in the PI3K/mTORpathway were not associated with response. ERBB2 amplification was higher in BCBMcompared to primary BC; ERBB2 amplification in the primary BC trended towardworse OS.CONCLUSION: While intracranial RR to ETV was low in HER2 + BCBM patients,one-third achieved CNS CBR; TTP/OS was similar to historical control. No newtoxicity signals were observed. Further analysis of the genomic underpinnings ofBCBM to identify tractable prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers is warranted.CLINICAL TRIAL: (NCT01305941).

We aimed to determine the postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy foresophageal cancer in elderly patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, population-based analysis was performedusing the National inpatient sample for the period 2000-2014. Adult patients ≥18years old (yo) diagnosed with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomyduring their inpatient hospitalization were included. Patients were categorizedinto <70 yo and ≥70 yo. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were usedto assess the potential effect of age on postoperative complications, inpatientmortality, and hospital charges.RESULTS: Overall, 5243 patients were included, with 3699 (70.6%) <70 yo and 1544(29.5%) ≥70 yo. The yearly rate of esophagectomies among patients ≥70 yo did notsignificantly changed during the study period (28.4% in 2000 and 26.3% in 2014,P = 0.76). Elderly patients were significantly more likely to have postoperativecardiac failure (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21, 2.09,P = 0.0009) and inpatient mortality (odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.39, 2.45,P < 0.0001). Among the elderly patients, hospital charges were, on average,$16,320 greater (95% CI $3110, $29,530) than patients <70 yo (P = 0.02). Thepredicted probability of mortality increased consistently across age (1.5% in 40yo, 2.5% in 50 yo, 3.6% in 60 yo, 5.4% in 70 yo, and 7.0% in 80 yo).CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer have asignificantly higher risk of postoperative mortality and pose a higher financialburden on the health care system. Elderly patients with esophageal cancer shouldbe carefully selected for surgery.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The inverse associationwith premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly characterized but might beimportant in the understanding of breast cancer causation.Objective: To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancerrisk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer,and tumor characteristics.Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter analysis used pooledindividual-level data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospectivecohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer inassociation with BMI from ages 18 through 54 years using Cox proportional hazardsregression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years (interquartile range,4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast cancer.Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, anddata were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017.Exposures: Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54years.Main Outcomes and Measures: Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer.Results: Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years;interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linearassociations of BMI with breast cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMIat ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95% CI,0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per 5.0-U difference, 0.88;95% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even amongnonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest andlowest BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95%CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or betweenstrata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger forestrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive than for hormonereceptor-negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor-positive andprogesterone receptor-positive tumors, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormonereceptor-negative tumors, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 yearswas not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor-negativebreast cancer overall.Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that increasedadiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at agreater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution ofBMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood.Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could haveimportant preventive potential.

We evaluated effect modification by race for exposure andpatient-outcomes associations with colorectal tumor methylation among 218 AA and267 EA colorectal cancer cases from the population-based North Carolina ColonCancer Study. Tumor methylation was assessed in CACNA1G, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3,and SOCS1. We used logistic regression to assess whether associations betweenseveral lifestyle factors-intake of fruits, vegetables, folate, and non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs-and tumor methylation were modified by race. Proportionalhazards models were used to evaluate whether race modified associations betweentumor methylation and time to all-cause mortality. Greater fruit consumption wasassociated with greater odds of high NEUROG1 methylation among EA at methylationcut points of 15-35% (maximum OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.66, 7.13) but not among AA.Higher folate intake was associated with lower odds of high CACNA1G methylationamong EAs but not AAs. Tumor methylation was not associated with all-causemortality for either group. Race might modify associations between lifestylefactors and colorectal tumor methylation, but in this sample did not appear tomodify associations between tumor methylation and all-cause mortality.

Risk assessment based on FamHxMI,conditional on smoking status, was examined given the strong influence of smokingon PD. Exploratory analysis with inflammatory biomarkers and genetic determinantswas conducted to understand potential mechanistic links. The Women's GenomeHealth Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort of US female health careprofessionals who provided blood samples at baseline in the Women's Health Study,a 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial investigating vitamin E and aspirin in theprevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. PD was ascertained viaself-report over 12 y of follow-up. Prevalence (3,442 cases), incidence (1,365cases), and survival analysis of PD were investigated for associations of FamHxMIas well as in strata of FamHxMI by smoking. Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square tests,multivariate regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for theanalyses. In the WGHS, women with FamHxMI showed higher risk of ever having PD. Aparticularly high-risk group of having both FamHxMI and smoking at baseline washighlighted in the prevalence and risk of developing PD. PD risk increasedaccording to the following strata: no FamHxMI and nonsmokers (reference), FamHxMIand nonsmokers (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.5), smokers withoutFamHxMI (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5), and smokers with FamHxMI (HR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.2 to 1.8). An independent analysis by the dental Atherosclerosis Risk inCommunities study ( N = 5,552) identified more severe periodontitis cases amongparticipants in the high-risk group (smokers with FamHxMI). Further examinationof interactions among inflammatory biomarkers or genetic exploration with FamHxMIdid not explain the risk increase of PD associated with FamHxMI in the WGHS.Future efforts based on an integrative-omics approach may facilitate validationof these findings and suggest a mechanistic link between PD and FamHxMI.

We aimed to compare the long-term survival outcomes betweendefinitive chemoradiation (dCR) and chemoradiation plus surgery (CRS) in patientswith stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Using the National CancerInstitute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry,adults (≥ 18 years old) with diagnosis of AJCC 6th edition stage III EAC (T3/N1,T4/N0, and T4/N1) between 2004 and 2014 were included. A multivariable Coxregression was used to assess the effect of dCR and CRS on mortality. Of the 2633patients included, 1115 (42%) underwent Dcr, and 1518 (58%) underwent CRS. The5-year survival rate was 13% for patients undergoing dCR and 27% for patientsundergoing CRS (p < 0.0001). Our observational data suggest that patients withstage III EAC may benefit by the use of esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with wastingof peripheral tissues, a metabolic syndrome that lowers quality of life and hasbeen proposed to decrease survival of patients with cancer3,4. Tissue wasting isa multifactorial disease and targeting specific circulating factors to reversethis syndrome has been mostly ineffective in the clinic5,6. Here we show thatloss of both adipose and muscle tissue occurs early in the development ofpancreatic cancer. Using mouse models of PDAC, we show that tumour growth in thepancreas but not in other sites leads to adipose tissue wasting, suggesting thattumour growth within the pancreatic environment contributes to this wastingphenotype. We find that decreased exocrine pancreatic function is a driver ofadipose tissue loss and that replacement of pancreatic enzymes attenuatesPDAC-associated wasting of peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, reversal of adiposetissue loss impairs survival in mice with PDAC. When analysing patients withPDAC, we find that depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues at the timeof diagnosis is common, but is not associated with worse survival. Takentogether, these results provide an explanation for wasting of adipose tissue inearly PDAC and suggest that early loss of peripheral tissue associated withpancreatic cancer may not impair survival.

These strategies are primarily focused on CD8+ T cells andapproaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV antigen production frominfected cells and poor HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. γδ T cells represent a uniquesubset of effector T cells that can traffic to tissues, and selectively targetcancer or virally infected cells without requiring MHC presentation. We analyzedwhether γδ T cells represent a complementary/alternative immunotherapeuticapproach towards HIV cure strategies. γδ T cells from HIV-infected virologicallysuppressed donors were expanded with bisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) and cellswere used in autologous cellular systems ex vivo. These cells (a) are potentcytotoxic effectors able to efficiently inhibit HIV replication ex vivo, (b)degranulate in the presence of autologous infected CD4+ T cells, and (c)specifically clear latently infected cells after latency reversal withvorinostat. This is the first proof of concept to our knowledge showing that γδ Tcells target and clear autologous HIV reservoirs upon latency reversal. Ourresults open potentially new insights into the immunotherapeutic use of γδ Tcells for current interventions in HIV eradication strategies.

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness ofdifferent cervical cancer screening strategies among women with HIV in SouthAfrica.METHODS: We modified a mathematical model of HPV infection and cervical diseaseto reflect coinfection with HIV. The model was calibrated to epidemiologic datafrom HIV-infected women in South Africa. Clinical and economic data were drawnfrom in-country data sources. The model was used to project reductions in thelifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios(ICERs) of Pap and HPV DNA screening and management algorithms beginning at HIVdiagnosis, at 1-, 2-, or 3-year intervals. Strategies with an ICER below SouthAfrica's 2016 per capita gross domestic product (US$5270) were considered"cost-effective."RESULTS: HPV testing followed by treatment (test-and-treat) at 2-year intervalswas the most effective strategy that was also cost-effective, reducing lifetimecancer risk by 56.6% with an ICER of US$3010 per year of life saved. Othercost-effective strategies included Pap (referral threshold: HSIL+) at 1-, 2-, and3-year intervals, and HPV test-and-treat at 3-year intervals. Pap (ASCUS+), HPVtesting with 16/18 genotyping, and HPV testing with Pap or visual triage ofHPV-positive women were less effective and more costly than alternatives.CONCLUSIONS: Considering per capita gross domestic product as the benchmark forcost-effectiveness, HPV test-and-treat is optimal in South Africa. At lowercost-effectiveness benchmarks, Pap (HSIL+) would be optimal.

Both patientswere diagnosed with HCC on screening magnetic resonance imaging shortly afterbeginning DAA therapy. Both patients achieved sustained virologic response (SVR)with dramatic improvement in HCC tumor burden on follow-up imaging without HCCtreatment. Patients with multifocal or advanced HCC are infrequently treated withantiviral therapy for HCV. As a result, these cases provide unique insight intothe ongoing debate regarding the impact of SVR on existing and recurrent HCC. Wereview the current literature regarding this debate, as well as the theory ofimmunosurveillance. We postulate that DAA therapy activates CD8+ T cells toinduce a T-cell-mediated response and increased immunosurveillance tovirus-induced liver cancer.

Thenaturally produced pterostilbene was selected as the lead compound for design andsynthesis of a series of bis(hydroxymethyl)propionate-based prodrugs. Allderivatives were screened for antiproliferative effects against thecisplatin-resistant oral squamous (CAR) cell line and the results indicated thatseveral compounds demonstrated superior inhibitory activity compared withpterostilbene and resveratrol. Among them, the most promising compound, 12, wasevaluated for in vivo antitumor activity in a CAR xenograft nude mouse model.Obvious antitumor activity was observed at the lowest oral dose (25 mg/kg/day).Increasing the dose of 12 to 100 mg/kg/day reduced the tumor size to 22% of thecontrol group. Based on these findings as well as the extremely low toxicity seenin the in vivo studies, we believe that compound 12 could serve as a new lead forfurther development.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects inhaled1 L of HP-129Xe mixture, followed by the acquisition of interleaved ventilationand gas exchange images, from which maps were obtained of the relative HP-129Xedistribution in three states: (1) gaseous, in lung airspaces; (2) dissolvedinterstitially, in alveolar barrier tissue; and (3) transferred to red bloodcells (RBCs), in the capillary vasculature. The relative spatial distributions ofHP-129Xe in airspaces (regional ventilation) and RBCs (regional gas transfer)were compared. Further, we investigated the degree to which ventilation and RBCtransfer images identified similar functional regions of interest (ROIs) suitablefor functionally guided RT. For the RT patients, both ventilation and RBCfunctional images were used to calculate differences in the lung dose-functionhistogram and functional effective uniform dose.RESULTS: The correlation of ventilation and RBC transfer was ρ = 0.39 ± 0.15 inhealthy volunteers. For the RT patients, this correlation was ρ = 0.53 ± 0.02before treatment and ρ = 0.39 ± 0.07 after treatment; for the emphysema patientit was ρ = 0.24. Comparing functional ROIs, ventilation and RBC transferdemonstrated poor spatial agreement: Dice similarity coefficient = 0.50 ± 0.07and 0.26 ± 0.12 for the highest-33%- and highest-10%-function ROIs in healthyvolunteers, and in RT patients (before treatment) these were 0.58 ± 0.04 and0.40 ± 0.04. The average magnitude of the differences between RBC- andventilation-derived functional effective uniform dose, fV20Gy, fV10Gy, and fV5Gywere 1.5 ± 1.4 Gy, 4.1% ± 3.8%, 5.0% ± 3.8%, and 5.3% ± 3.9%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Ventilation may not be an effective surrogate for true regional lungfunction for all patients.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This international, double-blind,placebo-controlled, multicenter trial assessed the efficacy of regorafenib withfolinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line treatmentfor metastatic colorectal cancer.METHODS: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed on first-lineoxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine enrolled at 45 sites in the United States andIreland. Patients, stratified by prior bevacizumab use, were randomized 2:1 toregorafenib or placebo. The treatment consisted of FOLFIRI on days 1 and 2 anddays 15 and 16 with 160 mg of regorafenib or placebo on days 4 to 10 and days 18to 24 of every 28-day cycle. Crossover was not allowed. The primary endpoint wasprogression-free survival (PFS). Under the assumption of a 75% event rate, 180patients were required for 135 events to achieve 90% power to detect a hazardratio (HR) of 0.65 with a 1-sided α value of .1.RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized (120 toregorafenib-FOLFIRI and 61 to placebo-FOLFIRI) with a median age of 62 years.Among these, 117 (65%) received prior bevacizumab or aflibercept. PFS was longerwith regorafenib-FOLFIRI than placebo-FOLFIRI (median, 6.1 vs 5.3 months; HR,0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.01; log-rank P = .056). The medianoverall survival was not longer (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.71-1.44). The response ratewas higher with regorafenib-FOLFIRI (34%; 95% CI, 25%-44%) than placebo-FOLFIRI(21%; 95% CI, 11%-33%; P = .07). Grade 3/4 adverse events with a >5% absoluteincrease from regorafenib included diarrhea, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia,hypophosphatemia, and hypertension.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of regorafenib to FOLFIRI as second-line therapy formetastatic colorectal cancer only modestly prolonged PFS over FOLFIRI alone.Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.^© 2018 American Cancer Society.

Weimplemented a biopsy protocol to perform time-sensitive whole-exome sequencingand RNA sequencing for patients with advanced PDAC. Therapeutically relevantgenomic alterations were identified in 48% (34/71) and pathogenic/likelypathogenic germline alterations in 18% (13/71) of patients. Overall, 30% (21/71)of enrolled patients experienced a change in clinical management as a result ofgenomic data. Twenty-six patients had germline and/or somatic alterations inDNA-damage repair genes, and 5 additional patients had mutational signatures ofhomologous recombination deficiency but no identified causal genomic alteration.Two patients had oncogenic in-frame BRAF deletions, and we report the firstclinical evidence that this alteration confers sensitivity to MAPK pathwayinhibition. Moreover, we identified tumor/stroma gene expression signatures withclinical relevance. Collectively, these data demonstrate the feasibility andvalue of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC.Significance:Molecular analyses of metastatic PDAC tumors are challenging due to theheterogeneous cellular composition of biopsy specimens and rapid progression ofthe disease. Using an integrated multidisciplinary biopsy program, we demonstratethat real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC can identify clinicallyrelevant alterations that inform management of this difficult disease.

To inform efforts to counsel parents more effectively, we sought toquantify their views on the best and worst reasons for guideline-consistent HPVvaccination. We hypothesized that parents' views would differ according to theirvaccination confidence.Methods: We developed a best-worst scaling experiment toevaluate 11 reasons healthcare providers commonly give for HPV vaccination. Theinstrument was administered in 2016 via a national online survey to 1,177 parentsof adolescents. Parents completed 11 choice tasks of 5 reasons each, indicatingthe best and worst reason in each task. We used conditional logistic regressionto rank reasons for the sample overall and by vaccination confidence(low/high).Results: Parents viewed cancer prevention as the best reason for HPVvaccination (P < 0.001). Other commonly endorsed reasons were preventing a commoninfection, having lasting benefits, or being a safe vaccine (all P < 0.001).Reasons viewed as worst were: It is a scientific breakthrough; I got it for myown child; and your child is due (all P < 0.001). Stratified analyses indicatedsmall differences in how often parents with low versus high vaccinationconfidence endorsed messages (P < 0.001), but the two groups ranked reasonssimilarly overall.Conclusions: Parents prioritized cancer prevention as the bestreason for guideline-consistent HPV vaccination. Several other common reasons,including having vaccinated one's own child, may warrant additionaltesting.Impact: Providers should emphasize cancer prevention when discussing HPVvaccination, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,the President's Cancer Panel, and others.

Electronic address:nvanderw@westclinic.com.^OBJECTIVES: The agreement between clinician- and patient-reported toxicities andtheir association with poor tolerance to therapy were assessed in an olderpopulation receiving curative radiotherapy (RT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients ≥ 65 years old with newly-diagnosed head and neckor lung cancer receiving curative RT ± chemotherapy were enrolled on aprospective, observational study. Agreement between clinician (CTCAEv4.02) andpatient (PRO-CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C30) report of toxicities were assessed atbaseline, during treatment, and post-treatment. The association of clinician- andpatient-reported symptoms with poor tolerance to therapy (defined ashospitalization, >3-day treatment delay, change in treatment regimen, or death)was assessed.RESULTS: Among 45 patients, median age was 71, 60% had head and neck cancer, and47% received concurrent chemotherapy with RT. In comparing CTCAE vs PRO-CTCAE,there was good agreement at baseline except for fatigue, anorexia, and pain,where clinicians under-reported the severity. The discrepancy increased duringtreatment with clinicians reporting lower severity in ≥50% of matched pairs for4/10 symptoms assessed. At follow-up, clinicians under-reported severity in ≥50%of pairs for 7/10 symptoms. CTCAE vs EORTC QLQ-C30 mirrored these findings.Patient-reported symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at 2 weeks andclinician-observed symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at 4 weeks were associatedwith poor tolerance to therapy.CONCLUSION: Clinicians under-report toxicities during and after curative RT inolder patients with head and neck or lung cancer.

Participants aged ≥50 years with type2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to receive liraglutide(≤1.8 mg daily; n = 4,668) or placebo (n = 4,672) in addition to standard careand monitored for 3.5-5 years (median follow-up 3.8 years). The occurrence ofneoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analysesof the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Coxregression model.RESULTS: Neoplasm was confirmed in 10.1% of patients with liraglutide versus 9.0%with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12 [95% CI 0.99; 1.28]). The HR (95% CI) forliraglutide versus placebo was 1.06 (0.90; 1.25) for malignant neoplasms and 1.16(0.93; 1.44) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasmsoccurring <1 year or <2 years after randomization and analyses by sex providedsimilar results. In our main analyses, the 95% CI for the HR included one for allmalignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) exceptfor prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.CONCLUSIONS: LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firmconclusions cannot be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individualneoplasm types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER datado, however, exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasmswith liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assesslonger-term exposure.^© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

For women who developbreast cancer early, the genetic architecture is less established.Methods: Toidentify loci associated with early-onset breast cancer, gene-based tests werecarried out using exome array data from 3,479 women with breast cancer diagnosedbefore age 50 and 973 age-matched controls. Replication was undertaken in apopulation that developed breast cancer at all ages of onset.Results: Three generegions were associated with breast cancer incidence: FGFR2 (P = 1.23 × 10-5;replication P < 1.00 × 10-6), NEK10 (P = 3.57 × 10-4; replication P < 1.00 ×10-6), and SIVA1 (P = 5.49 × 10-4; replication P < 1.00 × 10-6). Of the 151 generegions reported in previous literature, 19 (12.5%) showed evidence ofassociation (P < 0.05) with the risk of early-onset breast cancer in theearly-onset population. To predict incidence, whole-genome prediction wasimplemented on a subset of 3,076 participants who were additionally genotyped ona genome wide array. The whole-genome prediction outperformed a polygenic riskscore [AUC, 0.636; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.614-0.659 compared with 0.601;95% CI, 0.578-0.623], and when combined with known epidemiologic risk factors,the AUC rose to 0.662 (95% CI, 0.640-0.684).Conclusions: This research supports arole for variation within FGFR2 and NEK10 in breast cancer incidence, andsuggests SIVA1 as a novel risk locus.Impact: This analysis supports a sharedgenetic etiology between women with early- and late-onset breast cancer, andsuggests whole-genome data can improve risk assessment.

Thesetumors exhibited high aneuploidy and a paucity of somatic mutations. Somaticmutation of only three genes achieved significance-KIT, KRAS, andNRAS-exclusively in samples with seminoma components. Integrated analysesidentified distinct molecular patterns that characterized the major recognizedhistologic subtypes of TGCT: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, andteratoma. Striking differences in global DNA methylation and microRNA expressionbetween histology subtypes highlight a likely role of epigenomic processes indetermining histologic fates in TGCTs. We also identified a subset of pureseminomas defined by KIT mutations, increased immune infiltration, globallydemethylated DNA, and decreased KRAS copy number. We report potential biomarkersfor risk stratification, such as miRNA specifically expressed in teratoma, andothers with molecular diagnostic potential, such as CpH (CpA/CpC/CpT) methylationidentifying embryonal carcinomas.

This prospective,hypothesis-generating pilot study investigates the relationship between interimPET imaging during CRT for anal canal cancer and clinical outcome.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 2012 to August 2015, 30 patients with anal canalcancer were enrolled in a prospective clinical study of PET prior to and duringCRT after ∼30 Gy. PET parameters of the primary site included maximumstandardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and totallesion glycolysis (TLG). MTV and TLG were calculated based on 40% SUVmax (MTV40,TLG40) or SUV 2.5 (MTV2.5, TLG2.5) thresholds for pretreatment and interimimages. Absolute and change in PET parameters were assessed for association withfreedom from local and regional recurrence (FFLR) using single-predictor Coxregression models. Local and regional recurrence were primary and nodal(in-field) recurrences, respectively.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were eligible for analysis. Patients were excludedwith nonsquamous cell histology, recurrent anal cancer, and incomplete studiesdue to treatment toxicity or patient choice. Median follow-up was 2.5 years.Pretreatment MTV40 (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.02-2.05]), interim MTV2.5 (1.4 [1.04-1.89]),and interim TLG2.5 (1.1 [1.01-1.21]) were associated with FFLR.CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective pilot study, interim PET parameters wereassociated with FFLR. These results warrant further investigation assessing thevalue of interim PET as a biomarker of response in the treatment of patients withanal cancer.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic address: joseph.ciccolini@univ-amu.fr.^There is a rising evidence that the proverbial statement "No pain, No gain" firstcoined at the light of pioneering clinical experiences with canonicalchemotherapy still holds true in the era of modern treatments of cancer. Thisclose relationship between the occurrence of specific drug-related toxicity andtreatment outcome has been confirmed since then with a large variety oftreatments, ranging from cytotoxics, hormonotherapy, targeted therapy and muchinterestingly even with the latest immune checkpoint inhibitors. In the currentcontext of precision medicine, and along with the constant quest for identifyingpredictive biomarkers, close monitoring of treatment-related toxicities couldtherefore be convenient to help predicting therapeutic response, but presentsseveral caveats. The purpose of this review is to briefly describe theserelationships across the different treatments, to comment on possible underlyingmechanisms and to comment on possible strategies aiming at exploiting thisrelationship while keeping the maximal safety ensured in patients with cancer. Inparticular, this review will investigate on how drug exposure along with germinaland somatic genetic issues does impact on the "No Pain, No Gain" aphorism, andwhy the temptation to use treatment-related toxicities as a cheap and convenientway to predict clinical outcome or to adapt dosing should be resisted. We doadvocate instead for developing comprehensive genomic support along withextensive biomathematical modeling to better customize dosing and shift towards anew "No Pain, Maximal Gain" paradigm.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Early detection is of utmost importance for cancerprevention and disease management. Currently, tissue biopsy remains the goldstandard for oral cancer diagnosis, but it is invasive, which may cause patientdiscomfort. The application of traditional noninvasive methods-such as vitalstaining, exfoliative cytology, and molecular imaging-is limited by insufficientsensitivity and specificity. Thus, there is an urgent need for exploringnoninvasive, highly sensitive, and specific diagnostic techniques. Nano detectionsystems are known as new emerging noninvasive strategies that bring the detectionsensitivity of biomarkers to nano-scale. Moreover, compared to current imagingcontrast agents, nanoparticles are more biocompatible, easier to synthesize, andable to target specific surface molecules. Nanoparticles generate localizedsurface plasmon resonances at near-infrared wavelengths, providing higher imagecontrast and resolution. Therefore, using nano-based techniques can helpclinicians to detect and better monitor diseases during different phases of oralmalignancy. Here, we review the progress of nanotechnology-based methods in oralcancer detection and diagnosis.

Developing NTR-targeted PET probes could therefore be important for themanagement of a pancreatic cancer patient by providing key information on the NTRexpression profile noninvasively. Despite the initial success on the synthesis of18F-labeled NT PET probes, the labeling procedure generally requires lengthysteps including azeotropic drying of 18F. Using a straightforward chelationmethod, here we report the simple preparation of aluminum-18F-NOTA-NT startingfrom aqueous 18F. The cell binding test demonstrated that [19F]AlF-NOTA-NTmaintained high receptor-binding affinity to NTR1. This probe was then furtherevaluated in NTR1 positive pancreatic tumor models (AsPC-1 and PANC-1). After theadministration of [18F]AlF-NOTA-NT, small animal PET studies showed a highcontrast between tumor and background in both models at 1 and 4 h time points. Ablocking experiment was performed to demonstrate the receptor specificity: thetumor uptake in AsPC1 without and with blocking agent was 1.0 ± 0.2 and 0.1 ±0.0%ID/g, respectively, at 4 h post injection. In summary, a NTR specific PETagent, [18F]AlF-NOTA-NT, was prepared through the simple chelation method. ThisNTR-targeted PET probe may not only be used to detect NTR1 positive pancreatictumors (diagnosis), but also it may be fully integrated to NTR target therapyleading to personalized medicine (theranostic).

Here we report the combination ofimmunogenic chemotherapy and locally expressed PD-L1 trap fusion protein forefficacious and safe cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate that oxaliplatin (OxP)boosts anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy against murine colorectal cancer. By design of aPD-L1 trap and loading its coding plasmid DNA into a lipid-protamine-DNAnanoparticle, PD-L1 trap is produced transiently and locally in the tumormicroenvironment, and synergizes with OxP for tumor inhibition. Significantly,unlike the combination of OxP and anti-PD-L1 mAb, the combination of OxP andPD-L1 trap does not induce obvious Th17 cells accumulation in the spleen,indicating better tolerance and lower tendency to irAEs. The reports here mayhighlight the potential of applying PD-L1 inhibitor, especially locally expressedPD-L1 trap, in cancer therapy following OxP-based chemotherapy.

Afterethnographic research to identify design challenges, we held a user-centereddesign (UCD) workshop to begin to develop patient- and caregiver-centeredinterventions to support preparation for and recovery after complex cancersurgery.METHODS: Concepts that emerged from brainstorming sessions were visuallyrepresented on storyboards and rated. Highly scored concepts were furtherdeveloped in break-out prototyping sessions and then presented to the entiregroup for review in person and during subsequent webinars. We collected workshopproducts (worksheets, prototypes, and recordings) for analysis to identifyopportunities for intervention. The workshop, held in late 2014, was attended bythree colorectal/oncologic surgeons, three urologic surgeons, five ostomy nurses,one quality improvement leader, three patients, one caregiver, and threeexperienced UCD facilitators.RESULTS: Three opportunity areas were identified: (1) enhanced patient educationincluding tele-health and multi-media tools (available at hospitals/clinics oronline in any setting), (2) personalized discharge assessment and care planning,and (3) integrated symptom monitoring and educational interventions. Stakeholdersreached consensus that enhanced patient education was the most importantdirection for subsequent intervention development.CONCLUSIONS: We engaged diverse stakeholders in a participatory, UCD process andconcluded that research and practice improvement should prioritize thedevelopment of educational interventions in the pre-operative period to set thegroundwork for improving appropriate self-care during recovery from majorcolorectal and bladder cancer surgeries.

Two NF-κB pathways have been described to mediate theseresponses, the canonical and the noncanonical. While understudied compared to thecanonical NF-κB pathway, noncanonical NF-κB and its components have been shown tohave effects, usually protumorigenic, in many different cancer types. Here, wereview noncanonical NF-κB pathways and discuss its important roles in promotingcancer. We also discuss alternative NF-κB-independent functions of some thecomponents of noncanonical NF-κB signaling. Finally, we discuss importantcrosstalk between canonical and noncanonical signaling, which blurs the twopathways, indicating that understanding the full picture of NF-κB regulation iscritical to deciphering how this broad pathway promotes oncogenesis.

We identified 7608CH-associated mutations in the blood of 4628 (26.5%) patients. A total of 1075(14.1%) CH-associated mutations were also detectable in the matched tumor aboveestablished thresholds for calling somatic mutations. Overall, 912 (5.2%)patients would have had at least 1 CH-associated mutation erroneously called astumor derived in the absence of matched blood sequencing. A total of 1061 (98.7%)of these mutations were absent from population scale databases of germlinepolymorphisms and therefore would have been challenging to filter informatically.Annotating variants with OncoKB classified 534 (49.7%) as oncogenic or likelyoncogenic.Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates how CH-derived mutations couldlead to erroneous reporting and treatment recommendations when tumor-onlysequencing is used.

Weexplored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Usingin vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitinchains with the Lys63 (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the"DNA-interacting patch" (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr9,Lys11, and Glu34 Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chainsto DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction withan Ile44 patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimentalor cancer patient-derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA bindingcapacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chainaccumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repairand increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results thereforehighlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains inbinding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.^Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.

Hypertension iscommonly observed during bevacizumab treatment, and high-grade toxicity can limittherapy or lead to cardiovascular complications. The factors that contribute tointerindividual variability in blood pressure rise during bevacizumab treatmentare not well understood.Experimental Design: To identify genomic regionsassociated with bevacizumab-induced hypertension risk, sequencing of candidategenes and flanking regulatory regions was performed on 61 patients treated withbevacizumab (19 cases developed early-onset grade 3 hypertension and 42 controlshad no reported hypertension in the first six cycles of treatment). SNP-basedtests for common variant associations and gene-based tests for rare variantassociations were performed in 174 candidate genes.Results: Four common variantsin independent linkage disequilibrium blocks between SLC29A1 and HSP90AB1 wereamong the top associations. Validation in larger bevacizumab-treated cohortssupported association between rs9381299 with early grade 3+ hypertension (P =0.01; OR, 2.4) and systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg (P = 0.02; OR, 2.1).rs834576 was associated with early grade 3+ hypertension in CALGB 40502 (P =0.03; OR, 2.9). These SNP regions are enriched for regulatory elements that maypotentially increase gene expression. In vitro overexpression of SLC29A1 in humanendothelial cells disrupted adenosine signaling and reduced nitric oxide levelsthat were further lowered upon bevacizumab exposure.Conclusions: The genomicregion between SLC29A1 and HSP90AB1 and its role in regulating adenosinesignaling are key targets for further investigation into the pathogenesis ofbevacizumab-induced hypertension.

We characterized physician and parentsupport for pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination for adolescents who are past duefor vaccination.Methods: In 2014 to 2015, we conducted two national U.S. surveysof 776 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 1,504 parents of adolescents.Respondents indicated the extent to which they supported pharmacist-provided HPVvaccination for 13- to 17-year-olds who are past due. Respondents could endorsethe provision unconditionally, or only if certain conditions were met, such aspharmacists receiving proper vaccination training. We used multivariable logisticregression to assess correlates of support.Results: Most physicians (79%) andparents (81%) endorsed pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination if pharmacists hadreceived proper vaccination training, reported vaccine doses to adolescents' PCP,and referred adolescents to PCPs for other health services. Family medicinephysicians were more likely than pediatricians to support trained pharmacistsproviding HPV vaccination [OR = 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.22].Support was also higher among physicians who practiced in Western states (OR =2.11; 95% CI, 1.30-3.40). Parents' odds of endorsing trained pharmacistsprovision of HPV vaccine increased with higher overall satisfaction with theirpharmacy's services (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19), belief in pharmacists'competence in vaccination practices (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70), and overallvaccine confidence (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.48).Conclusions: To increasesupport for HPV vaccination services, pharmacists should raise awareness abouttheir immunization training and standardize vaccination protocols that ensurecoordination with primary care.Impact: Stakeholders' feedback and buy-in isimportant to help guide expansion of HPV vaccination in pharmacies.

The primarymiRNA sequence was identified for 566 miRNA genes expressed in Encyclopedia ofDNA Elements (ENCODE) Tier 1 cell types and human pancreatic islets. Associationanalysis was conducted using logistic regression for BC status overall and bytumor subtype.RESULTS: A novel BC signal was localized to an 8.6-kb region of 17q25.3 by fourSNPs (rs9913477, rs1428882938, rs28585511, and rs7502931) and remainedstatistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44,95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-1.65; p = 3.15 × 10-7; false discovery rate(FDR) = 0.03). These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both thepredicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR3065 and the firstintron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein2 (BAIAP2). Furthermore, miRNA-associated SNPs on chromosomes 1p32.3, 5q32, and3p25.1 were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versusbasal-like, and HER2 enrichment status, respectively. A second phase ofgenotyping (1397 BC cases, 2418 controls) that included two SNPs in the 8.6-kbregion was used for validation and meta-analysis. While neither rs4969239 norrs9913477 was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset theirassociation with BC remained directionally consistent (OR = 1.29, 95% CI =1.16-1.44 (p = 4.18 × 10-6) and OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.17-1.51 (p = 1.6 × 10-5),respectively).CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation indicates that MIR3065 may play animportant role in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women. Furtherinvestigation to determine the potential functional effects of these SNPs iswarranted. This study contributes to our understanding of BC risk in AA women andhighlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of thehuman genome.

Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adversehealth outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL sixmonths after starting therapy was associated with 10-year first cancer risk.METHODS: We followed 7,515 HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenterclinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. We used nonparametric multiple imputation toaccount for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorizedviral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20-199,200-999, and >999 copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidenceof cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverseprobability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control forconfounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively.RESULTS: Crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% CI:6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loadsbetween 200 and 999 copies/mL six months after ART initiation (10.7%). Aftercontrolling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95%CI: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories.CONCLUSION: Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viralsuppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients aftertreatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in thecurrent "treat all" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will beobserved more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study ofthe role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development.

Occupational exposure limits for silica are derived from a number oflines of evidence, including observational studies. Observational studies may besubject to healthy worker survivor bias, which could result in underestimates ofsilica's impact on worker mortality and, in turn, bias risk estimates foroccupational exposure limits.METHODS: Using data on 65,999 workers pooled across multiple industries, weestimate the impacts of several hypothetical occupational exposure limits onsilica exposure on lung cancer and all-cause mortality. We use the parametricg-formula, which can account for healthy worker survivor bias.RESULTS: Assuming we could eliminate occupational exposure, we estimate thatthere would be 20.7 fewer deaths per 1,000 workers in our pooled study by age 80(95% confidence interval = 14.5, 26.8), including 3.91 fewer deaths owing to lungcancer (95% CI = 1.53, 6.30). Less restrictive interventions demonstrated smallerbut still substantial risk reductions.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that occupational exposure limits for silica canbe further strengthened to reduce silica-associated mortality and illustrate howcurrent risk analysis for occupational limits can be improved.

Weidentified and quantified mutations in genes known to be frequently altered inclonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, ATM, CHEK2, SF3B1, CBL, JAK2)that were returned to physicians on clinical Foundation Medicine reports. For asubset of patients, we explored the frequency of true clonal hematopoiesis bycomparing mutations on Foundation Medicine reports with matched bloodsequencing.Results: Mutations in genes that are frequently altered in clonalhematopoiesis were identified in 65% (1,139/1,757) of patients undergoing NGS.When excluding TP53, which is often mutated in solid tumors, these events werestill seen in 35% (619/1,757) of patients. Utilizing paired blood specimens, wewere able to confirm that 8% (18/226) of mutations reported in these genes weretrue clonal hematopoiesis events. The majority of DNMT3A mutations (64%, 7/11)and minority of TP53 mutations (4%, 2/50) were clonal hematopoiesis.Conclusions:Clonal hematopoiesis mutations are commonly reported on unpaired NGS testing. Itis important to recognize clonal hematopoiesis as a possible cause ofmisattribution of mutation origin when applying NGS findings to a patient's care.Clin Cancer Res; 1-7. ©2018 AACR.^©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

Non-muscle-invasive bladdercancer survivors have unique chronic burdens including frequent recurrences,repeated surveillance cystoscopies and treatments, and the highest lifetimemedical cost per person among all cancers.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize studies assessing qualityof life (QOL) in NMIBC survivors.METHODS: The literature from January 2005 to March 2017 found in PubMed, CINAHL,and PsycINFO databases was reviewed systematically. Inclusion criteria were asfollows: (1) research about NMIBC survivors, (2) outcomes included QOL, (3)original research article published in peer-reviewed journals, and (4) publishedin English.RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included: 14 quantitative studies and 1mixed-methods study. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer survivors hadsignificantly lower QOL compared with the general population, especially infatigue, physical and role functioning, and mental health. Repeated transurethralresections and intravesical treatments were associated with impaired physicalfunction and mental health. Most NMIBC survivors had concerns of urinary andbowel problems and sexual function.CONCLUSION: Despite a good prognosis, NMIBC and its treatment have a significantimpact on QOL in survivors. The findings showed large burdens in NMIBC survivorsand suggest that further research is needed to better understand potentialopportunities to improve QOL in this population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are in the critical position forassessing symptoms and concerns. Oncology nurses should pay special attention toNMIBC survivors who have unique symptoms and burden with the aim of improvingsurvivors' QOL.

In this issue of the JCI, Szot et al.devised a strategy to exploit the cell-surface marker TEM8 (also known asANTXR1), which is expressed by cancer-associated stromal cells, as a zip code todeliver an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) linked to the potent cancer-killing drugmonomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In preclinical tumor and experimental metastasismodels of multiple cancer types, TEM8-ADC targeted TEM8-expressingcancer-associated stromal cells, which processed and liberated membrane-permeableMMAE and released this drug via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter.Released MMAE killed cancer cells through a bystander mechanism that did minimaldamage to the stromal cells themselves. P-gp-expressing tumor cells displayedMMAE resistance, suggesting that P-gp expression status may identify patients whomight benefit the most from TEM8-ADC. This strategy, termed DAaRTS (drugactivation and release through stroma), represents an elegant example of howselective expression of a cell-surface molecule on cancer-associated stroma canbe exploited to facilitate drug delivery and shrink solid tumors.

The epidemic began with an escalation ofprescription opioid deaths and has now evolved to include secondary waves ofillicit heroin and fentanyl deaths, while the deaths due to prescription opioidoverdoses are still increasing. In response, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) moved to limit opioid prescribing with the release of opioidprescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain in March 2016. The guidelinesrepresent a logical and timely federal response to this growing crisis. However,CDC acknowledged that the evidence base linking opioid prescribing to opioid usedisorders and overdose was grades 3 and 4.METHODS: Motivated by the need to strengthen the evidence base, this reviewdetails limitations of the opioid safety studies cited in the CDC guidelines witha focus on methodological limitations related to internal and external validity.RESULTS: Internal validity concerns were related to poor confounding control,variable misclassification, selection bias, competing risks, and potentialcompeting interventions. External validity concerns arose from the use of limitedsource populations, historical data (in a fast-changing epidemic), and issueswith handling of cancer and acute pain patients' data. We provide a nonexhaustivelist of 7 recommendations to address these limitations in future opioid safetystudies.CONCLUSION: Strengthening the opioid safety evidence base will aid any futurerevisions of the CDC guidelines and enhance their prevention impact.^Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Of the 9719 eligiblepatients with follow-up information, 6711 (69%) had a midrange recurrence scoreof 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive either chemoendocrine therapyor endocrine therapy alone. The trial was designed to show noninferiority ofendocrine therapy alone for invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedomfrom invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death).RESULTS: Endocrine therapy was noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in theanalysis of invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio for invasive diseaserecurrence, second primary cancer, or death [endocrine vs. chemoendocrinetherapy], 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.24; P=0.26). At 9 years, thetwo treatment groups had similar rates of invasive disease-free survival (83.3%in the endocrine-therapy group and 84.3% in the chemoendocrine-therapy group),freedom from disease recurrence at a distant site (94.5% and 95.0%) or at adistant or local-regional site (92.2% and 92.9%), and overall survival (93.9% and93.8%). The chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied withthe combination of recurrence score and age (P=0.004), with some benefit ofchemotherapy found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of16 to 25.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similarefficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillarynode-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score, althoughsome benefit of chemotherapy was found in some women 50 years of age or younger.(Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; TAILORx ClinicalTrials.govnumber, NCT00310180 .).

The extent to whichPolη function depends on the upstream E3 ubiquitin ligase Rad18 is controversialand has not been investigated using mouse models. Therefore, we tested the roleof Rad18 in UV-inducible skin tumorigenesis. Because Rad18 deficiency leads tocompensatory DNA damage signaling by Chk2, we also investigated geneticinteractions between Rad18 and Chk2 in vivo. Chk2-/-Rad18-/- mice were prone tospontaneous lymphomagenesis. Both Chk2-/- and Chk2-/-Rad18-/- mice were prone toUV-B irradiation-induced skin tumorigenesis when compared with wild-type (WT)animals, but unexpectedly Rad18-/- mice did not recapitulate the skin tumorpropensity of Polη mutants. UV-irradiated Rad18-/- cells were more susceptible toG1/S arrest and apoptosis than WT cultures. Chk2 deficiency alleviated bothUV-induced G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis of WT and Rad18-/- cells, but led toincreased genomic instability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that thetumor-suppressive role of Polη in UV-treated skin is Rad18 independent. We alsodefine a role for Chk2 in suppressing UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in vivo.This study identifies Chk2 dysfunction as a potential risk factor forsunlight-induced skin tumorigenesis in humans.^Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Others have correlated RT-related immunosuppression withworsened survival. Given the large vascular volumes irradiated during locallyadvanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) treatment, we hypothesized anassociation between increased heart dose and immunosuppression.METHODS: We identified 400 LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitiveRT ± chemotherapy between 2001 and 2016. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC),absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR = ANC/ALC) were analyzed pre-RT, during RT, and post-RT. Multivariableanalysis (MVA) was performed to correlate Clinical factors with both hematologictoxicity and overall survival. An upper tertile threshold to increase specificityof NLR was chosen to dichotomize continuous hematologic variables.RESULTS: Median follow up was 17 months (range 0.2-174 months) in all patientsand 46 months (range 0.2-161 months) in survivors. A total of 94% of patients hadstage III disease and 77% received concurrent chemo radiation. Two-year overallsurvival (OS), freedom from local recurrence (FFLR), and freedom from distantmetastases (FFDM) was 42%, 60% and 45%, respectively. Median survival was18 months. On MVA for OS (n = 207), male gender (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.7; 95% CI1.2-2.3), RT alone (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-4.0), the percentage of heart receiving≥50 Gy (V50) (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03), and higher NLR at 4 months (HR 1.02,95% CI 1.01-1.03) were associated with reduced OS. ALC nadir was not associatedwith treatment outcomes. NLR >10.5 was associated with decreased OS (p < 0.001)and decreased FFDM (p = 0.04). On MVA evaluating factors associated withhematological toxicity (n = 247), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3-5.0;p = 0.006), RT alone (HR 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-12; p = 0.04), and heart V50 >25% (HR2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.5; p = 0.02) were associated with a NLR >10.5 4 months post-RT.CONCLUSION: RT related immunosuppression is associated with worse patientoutcomes, and may represent a source of increased mortality beyond cardiactoxicity alone.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The diagnosis of pre-existing COPD in lungcancer patients was identified using ICD-9 codes. Healthcare utilization andcosts were categorized as inpatient hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility(SNF) use, physician office visits, ER visits, and outpatient encounters forevery stage of lung cancer. The adjusted analysis was performed using ageneralized linear model for healthcare costs and a negative binomial model forhealthcare utilization.RESULTS: Inpatient admissions in the COPD group increased for each stage ofnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to the non-COPD group per 100person-months (Stage I: 14.67 vs 9.49 stays, p < .0001; Stage II: 14.13 vs 10.78stays, p < .0001; Stage III: 28.31 vs 18.91 stays, p < .0001; Stage IV: 49.5 vs31.24 stays, p < .0001). A similar trend was observed for outpatient visits, withan increase in utilization among the COPD group (Stage I: 1136.04 vs 796 visits,p < .0001; Stage II: 1325.12 vs 983.26 visits, p < .0001; Stage III: 2025.47 vs1656.64 visits, p < .0001; Stage IV: 2825.73 vs 2422.26 visits, p < .0001). Totaldirect costs per person-month in patients with pre-existing COPD weresignificantly higher than the non-COPD group across all services ($54,799.16 vs$41,862.91). Outpatient visits represented the largest cost category across allservices in both groups, with higher costs among the COPD group ($41,203 vs$31,140.08).CONCLUSION: Healthcare utilization and costs among lung cancer patients withpre-existing COPD was ∼2-3-times higher than the non-COPD group.

The PtDA was designed to facilitate individualized decisionmaking-helping patients understand the potential risks, benefits, anduncertainties of CRC screening given advanced age, health state, preferences, andvalues.OUTCOMES: Two composite outcomes, appropriate CRC screening behavior 6 mo afterthe index visit and appropriate screening intent immediately after the visit,were defined as completed screening or intent for patients in good health,discussion about screening with their provider for patients in intermediatehealth, and no screening or intent for patients in poor health. Health state wasdetermined by age and Charlson Comorbidity Index.RESULTS: Four hundred twelve (97%) and 421 (99%) patients were analyzed for theprimary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Appropriate screening behavior at 6mo was higher in the intervention group (55% v. 45%, P = 0.023) as wasappropriate screening intent following the provider visit (61% v. 47%, P =0.003).LIMITATIONS: The study took place in a single geographic region.

In this study, we interrogated the dynamics of RNAlevels, ribosome occupancy, and protein expression as a function of inducible FGFsignaling in mouse mammary glands with constitutive WNT hyperactivation.Multiomics correlation analysis revealed a substantial discrepancy between RNAand ribosome occupancy levels versus protein levels. However, this discrepancydecreased as cells became premalignant and dynamically responded to FGFsignaling, implicating the importance of stringent gene regulation innontransformed cells. Analysis of individual genes demonstrated that acute FGFhyperactivation increased translation of many stem cell self-renewal regulators,including WNT signaling components, and decreased translation of genes regulatingcellular senescence. WNT pathway components translationally upregulated by FGFsignaling had long and structured 5' UTRs with a high frequency of polypurinesequences, several of which harbored (CGG)4 motifs that can fold into eitherstable G-quadruplexes or other stable secondary structures. The FGF-mediatedincrease in translation of WNT pathway components was compromised by silvestrol,an inhibitor of EIF4A that clamps EIF4A to polypurine sequences to block 43Sscanning and inhibits its RNA-unwinding activity important for translationinitiation. Moreover, silvestrol treatment significantly delayed FGF-WNT-driventumorigenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF signalingselectively enhances translation of structured mRNAs, particularly WNT signalingcomponents, and highlight their vulnerability to inhibitors that target the RNAhelicase EIF4A.Significance: The RNA helicase EIF4A may serve as a therapeutictarget for breast cancers that require FGF and WNT signaling.

Medical recordswere reviewed uniformly, and the following data were collected: age, sex,episodes of urinary symptoms, tumor size, number of tumors, location of thelargest tumor (lateral walls, base, posterior wall, dome, and anterior wall),tumor appearance (papillary or non-papillary, pedunculated or sessile), andurinary cytology. Data from 254 patients (Group A) were used for the developmentof a nomogram, while data from 170 patients (Group B) were used for its externalvalidation.RESULTS: High-grade papillary bladder cancer was pathologically diagnosed in 51.6and 74.6% of Group A and Group B patients, respectively. Based on univariableanalyses in Group A, macrohematuria, tumor size, multiple tumors, appearance, andpositive urinary cytology were selected as variables to incorporate into anomogram. The AUC value was 0.81 for the internal validation (Group A), and 0.78for the external validation (Group B). This novel nomogram can predict high-gradepapillary bladder cancer accurately.CONCLUSIONS: The present nomogram can help clinicians calculate the probabilityin patients with bladder cancer before TUR-Bt and decide on earlier interventionand priorities for the treatment of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer.

We wantedto determine the I-CRC rate per colonoscopy examination and to examine the effectof colonoscopy volume and adenoma detection rate (ADR) on the number of I-CRCsattributable to an endoscopist.METHODS: We determined the rate of I-CRC diagnosis per outpatient colonoscopyexamination by measuring the incidence of CRC diagnosis in practice and byassessing, via literature review, the percentage of cancers that are interval. Wealso estimated the number of attributable I-CRCs as a function of ADR andcolonoscopy volume.RESULTS: Among 93,562 colonoscopies performed in 2013 to 2015 by 120 physiciansin 4 diverse U.S. medical centers, 526 CRCs were diagnosed (.6%). Of 149,556 CRCsin the published literature, 7958 were I-CRCs (5.25% ± .94%). With rates of .6%(CRC per colonoscopy) and 5.25% (I-CRC per CRC), the rate of I-CRC is 1 per 3174colonoscopies (95% confidence interval, 1 per 2710 to 1 per 3875). An endoscopistat the median of outpatient colonoscopy volume (316/year) in the lowest ADRquintile of detection (7%-19%) would have an I-CRC attributed every 8.2 years, or4.2 I-CRCs in a 35-year career, versus every 16.7 years, or 2.0 I-CRCs in a35-year career, for an endoscopist in the highest ADR quintile (33%-52%).CONCLUSIONS: An average-volume endoscopist will have 2 to 4 attributable I-CRCsin a 35-year career, but the frequency will vary depending on colonoscopy volumeand ADR.

PCC, a key part of patient-centered care,contributes directly and indirectly to health-related quality of life,satisfaction with care, and other outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients in North Carolina, using atheoretically-based and validated measure that provides an overall PCC score andsubscale scores for six PCC functions.RESULTS: A total of 501 patients participated. The highest scores were for thePCC functions of Fostering Healing Relationships, Exchanging Information, andMaking Decisions. The lowest scores were for the functions of ManagingUncertainty and Enabling Self-Management, yet these were functions respondentsrated as most important. Respondents who thought about more than one healthprofessional (versus oncologist) reported better communication. PCC also variedby treatment type, mental and physical health status, age, race, and education.CONCLUSION: Most patients reported good communication overall, however patientsin poor physical health and mental health reported worse communication. Thequality of communication varied across the PCC functions.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals need to use a PCC approach thatbuilds trust, respects the patient, provides salient information that patientscan understand, provides emotional support, and facilitates the patient'sengagement in care.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Electronic address: khlee@unc.edu.^Fourteen novel amino-quinoline-5,8-dione derivatives (6a-h and 7a-h) weredesigned and synthesized by coupling different alkyl- or aryl-amino fragments atthe C6- or C7-position of quinoline-5,8-dione. All target compounds showedantiproliferative potency in the low micromolar range in both drug sensitiveHeLaS3 and multidrug resistant KB-vin cell lines. Compounds 6h, 6d, 7a, and 7dexhibited more potent antiproliferative effects than the other compounds.Especially, compounds 6d and 7d displayed NQO1-dependent cytotoxicity andcompetitive NQO1 inhibitory effects in both drug sensitive HeLaS3 and multidrugresistant KB-vin cell lines. Furthermore, compounds 6h, 6d, 7a, and 7d induced adose-dependent lethal mitochondrial dysfunction in both drug sensitive HeLaS3 andmultidrug resistant KB-vin cells by increasing intracellular reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) levels. Notably, compound 7d selectively inhibited cancer cells,but not non-tumor liver cell proliferation in vitro, and significantly triggeredHeLaS3 cell apoptosis by regulating apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2, Bax, and cleavedcaspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that these novel C6-or C7-substituted amino-quinoline-5,8-dione derivatives, such as 7d, could befurther developed in the future as potent and selective antitumor agents topotentially circumvent multi-drug resistance (MDR).^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

With modern antiretroviral therapy, PLWH are aging and cancerrates are changing.Objective: To project cancer incidence rates and burden (number of new cancerdiagnoses) among adult PLWH in the United States through 2030.Design: Descriptive.Setting: HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study to project cancer rates and HIV Optimizationand Prevention Economics model to project HIV prevalence.Participants: HIV-infected adults.Measurements: Projected cancer rates and burden among HIV-infected adults in theUnited States by age during 2006 to 2030 for AIDS-defining cancer (ADC)-that is,Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer-and certain types ofnon-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC). All other cancer types were combined.Results: The proportion of adult PLWH in the United States aged 65 years or olderis projected to increase from 8.5% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2030. Age-specific ratesare projected to decrease through 2030 across age groups for Kaposi sarcoma,non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and othercancer types combined, and among those aged 65 years or older for colon cancer.Prostate cancer rates are projected to increase. The estimated total cancerburden in PLWH will decrease from 8150 cases in 2010 (2730 of ADC and 5420 ofNADC) to 6690 cases in 2030 (720 of ADC and 5980 of NADC). In 2030, prostatecancer (n = 1590) and lung cancer (n = 1030) are projected to be the most commoncancer types.Limitation: Projections assume that current trends in cancer incidence rates, HIVtransmission, and survival will continue.Conclusion: The cancer burden among PLWH is projected to shift, with prostate andlung cancer expected to emerge as the most common types by 2030. Cancer willremain an important comorbid condition, and expanded access to HIV therapies andcancer prevention, screening, and treatment is needed.Primary Funding Source: National Cancer Institute.

We calculated mean monthly out-of-pocket payment for eachfill by patient. We then categorized oral oncolytics by their overall andprogression-free survival benefits for each FDA-approved indication, usingevidence from published studies. We assessed the relationship of survival benefitwith mean monthly out-of-pocket payment, adjusting for demographic and plancharacteristics.RESULTS: Our population included 44,113 patients aged 18-65 years (mean 52.5 [SD9.4]) with a cancer diagnosis who filled 731,354 prescriptions. The most commonlyrepresented oncolytics were imatinib (37.4% of fills), lenalidomide (17.7% offills), and dasatinib (10.0% of fills). Approximately 32.3% of fills were fordrug-indication pairs with an overall survival benefit of 4+ years. In adjustedanalyses, there was no clear pattern to suggest that out-of-pocket paymentsdiffered with drug indication-specific survival benefits. Drugs for indicationsproviding > 0 to 1 year of overall survival benefit were significantly morelikely to have a lower out-of-pocket payment versus those prescribed off-label,but there were no significant differences in out-of-pocket payments between drugsand associated indications in any other survival category versus drugs usedoff-label.CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket payments for oral oncolytics were not clearly relatedto indication-specific value in commercially insured patients. This findingsuggests that despite increased attention to value- and indication-based drugpricing, cost sharing for oral oncolytics does not currently reflect these goals.DISCLOSURES: This project was supported by Research Scholar GrantRSGI-14-030-01-CPHPS from the American Cancer Society; the NIH BuildingInterdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) K12 Program; theNorth Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (UL1TR001111) Grant;and K24CA181510 from the National Cancer Institute.

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding theirprevalence among older patients with cancer.METHODS: The current study was a secondary analysis combining 2 prospectivecohorts of adults aged ≥65 years with solid tumors who were receivingchemotherapy. The authors assessed the association between patient-reportedhearing and/or visual impairment (defined as fair/poor grading by self-report)and physical function, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), anxiety,depression, and cognition. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarizepatient and treatment characteristics. One-way analysis of variance andchi-square tests were conducted as appropriate to examine differences betweenpatients with and without sensory impairments. Logistic regression was used toanalyze associations between sensory impairments and outcomes.RESULTS: Among 750 patients with a median age of 72 years who had solid tumors(29% with breast/gynecological tumors, 28% with lung tumors, and 27% withgastrointestinal tumors), approximately 18% reported hearing impairment alone,11% reported visual impairment alone, and 7% reported dual sensory impairment.Hearing impairment was associated with IADL dependence (odds ratio [OR], 1.9),depression (OR, 1.6), and anxiety (OR, 1.6). Visual impairment was associatedwith IADL dependence (OR, 1.9), poor physical function (OR, 1.9), and depression(OR, 2.5). Dual impairment was associated with IADL dependence (OR, 2.8), anxiety(OR, 2.3), depression (OR, 2.5), and cognitive impairment (OR, 3.2).CONCLUSIONS: Sensory impairment is common among older adults with cancer.Patients with sensory impairment are more likely to have functional,psychological, and cognitive deficits. Interventions aimed at improving thevision and hearing of older adults with cancer should be studied. Cancer 2018. ©2018 American Cancer Society.^© 2018 American Cancer Society.

Serum cholesterol and testosterone weremeasured by ELISA and intraprostatic androgens by mass spectrometry. Prostatehistology was graded, and proliferation and apoptosis in tumor epithelium andstroma was assessed by Ki67 and TUNEL, respectively.RESULTS: Ezetimibe-treated mice had lower serum cholesterol at 4 months(p = 0.031). Serum cholesterol was positively correlated with prostate weight(p = 0.033) and tumor epithelial proliferation (p = 0.069), and negativelycorrelated with tumor epithelial apoptosis (p = 0.004). Serum cholesterol wasunrelated to body weight (p = 0.195). Tumor stromal cell proliferation wasreduced in the ezetimibe group (p = 0.010). Increased serum cholesterol at 4months was associated with elevated intraprostatic DHEA, testosterone, andandrostenedione (p = 0.043, p = 0.074, p = 0.031, respectively). However,cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect adenocarcinoma development at2, 3, or 4 months of age (0, 78, and 100% in ezetimibe-treated vs. 0, 80, and100% in mice not receiving ezetimibe).CONCLUSIONS: Though serum cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect therate of adenocarcinoma development in the PTEN-null transgenic mouse model ofprostate cancer, it lowered intraprostatic androgens and slowed tumor growth.These findings support a role for serum cholesterol in promoting prostate cancergrowth, potentially via enhanced tumor androgen signaling, and may provide newinsight into cholesterol-lowering interventions for prostate cancer treatment.

Abiraterone is a clinical first-in-classinhibitor of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) required for androgen biosynthesis.However, abiraterone also causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema, likely duein part to off-target inhibition of another steroidogenic cytochrome P450,CYP21A2. Abiraterone analogs were designed based on structural evidence thatB-ring substituents may favorably interact with polar residues in binding CYP17A1and sterically clash with residues in the CYP21A2 active site. The best analogsincreased selectivity of CYP17A1 inhibition up to 84-fold compared with 6.6-foldfor abiraterone. Cocrystallization with CYP17A1 validated the intended newcontacts with CYP17A1 active site residues. Docking these analogs into CYP21A2identified steric clashes that likely underlie decreased binding and CYP21A2inhibition. Overall, these analogs may offer a clinical advantage in the form ofreduced side effects.

Since 2006, national guidelines have recommendedfertility counseling for cancer patients. We examined childbirth after AYA cancerby calendar period, cancer diagnosis, and maternal characteristics.METHODS: We identified a cohort of women with an incident invasive AYA cancerdiagnosis at ages 15-39 during 2000-2013 in North Carolina. Cancer records werelinked with statewide birth certificates through 2014. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) for first post-diagnosis live birth were calculatedusing Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: Among 17,564 AYA cancer survivors, 1989 had ≥ 1 birth after diagnosisduring 98,397 person-years. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of live birthafter cancer was 10 and 15%, respectively. AYA survivors with a post-diagnosisbirth were younger at diagnosis, had lower stage disease, and had less oftenreceived chemotherapy than those without a birth. The 5-year cumulative incidenceof post-diagnosis birth was 10.0% for women diagnosed during 2007-2012, comparedto 9.4% during 2000-2005 (HR = 1.01; 0.91, 1.12), corresponding to periods beforeand after publication of American Society of Clinical Oncology fertilitycounseling guidelines in 2006.CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in fertility preservation options and recognitionof fertility counseling as a part of high-quality cancer care, the incidence ofpost-diagnosis childbirth has remained stable over the last 15 years.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our study uses statewide data to providerecent, population-based estimates of how often AYA women have biologicalchildren after a cancer diagnosis.

We describe here the first subtype-specific murine models ofbladder cancer and show that Upk3a-CreERT2; Trp53L/L; PtenL/L; Rosa26LSL-Luc(UPPL, luminal-like) and BBN (basal-like) tumors are more faithful to humanbladder cancer than the widely used MB49 cells. Following engraftment intoimmunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, BBN tumors were more responsive to PD-1 inhibitionthan UPPL tumors. Responding tumors within the BBN model showed differences inimmune microenvironment composition, including increased ratios of CD8+:CD4+ andmemory:regulatory T cells. Finally, we predicted and confirmed immunogenicity oftumor neoantigens in each model. These UPPL and BBN models will be a valuableresource for future studies examining bladder cancer biology andimmunotherapy.Significance: This work establishes human-relevant mouse models ofbladder cancer.

We examined factors associated with breast MRI use in a cohortof women with a family history of breast cancer but no personal cancer history.Study participants came from the Sister Study cohort, a nationwide, prospectivestudy of women with at least 1 sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancerbut who themselves had not ever had breast cancer (n = 17 894). Participants weresurveyed on breast cancer beliefs, cancer worry, breast MRI use, providercommunication, and genetic counseling and testing. Logistic regression was usedto assess factors associated with having a breast MRI overall and for those athigh risk. Breast MRI was reported by 16.1% and was more common among youngerwomen and those with higher incomes. After adjustment for demographics, ever useof breast MRI was associated with actual and perceived risk. Odds ratios (OR)were 12.29 (95% CI, 8.85-17.06), 2.48 (95% CI, 2.27-2.71), and 2.50 (95% CI,2.09-2.99) for positive BRCA1/2 test, lifetime breast cancer risk ≥ 20%, andbeing told by a health care provider of higher risk, respectively. Women whobelieved they had much higher risk than others or had higher level of worry weretwice as likely to have had breast MRI; OR = 2.23 (95% CI, 1.82-2.75) andOR = 1.76 (95% CI, 1.52-2.04). Patterns were similar among women at high risk.Breast cancer risk, provider communication, and personal beliefs weredeterminants of breast MRI use. To support shared decisions about the use ofbreast MRI, women could benefit from improved understanding of the chances ofgetting breast cancer and increased quality of provider communications.^© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Electronic address:mooneyd@seas.harvard.edu.^Local drug presentation made possible by drug-eluting depots has demonstratedbenefits in a vast array of diseases, including in cancer, microbial infectionand in wound healing. However, locally-eluting depots are single-use systems thatcannot be refilled or reused after implantation at inaccessible sites, limitingtheir clinical utility. New strategies to noninvasively refill drug-elutingdepots could dramatically enhance their clinical use. In this report we present arefillable hydrogel depot system based on bioorthogonal click chemistry. Theclick-modified hydrogel depots capture prodrug refills from the blood andsubsequently release active drugs locally in a sustained manner. Capture of thesystemically-administered refills serves as an efficient and non-toxic method torepeatedly refill depots. Refillable depots in combination with prodrug refillsachieve sustained release at precancerous tumor sites to improve cancer therapywhile eliminating systemic side effects. The ability to target tissues withoutenhanced permeability could allow the use of refillable depots in cancer and manyother medical applications.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Paskett, The Ohio State University, Columbus,OH; and Julia H. Rowland, Smith Center for Healing and the Arts, Washington, DC.^Purpose Numerous organizations recommend that patients with cancer receive asurvivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up careplans. Among current barriers to implementation are providers' concerns about thestrength of evidence that SCPs improve outcomes. This systematic review evaluateswhether delivery of SCPs has a positive impact on health outcomes and health caredelivery for cancer survivors. Methods Randomized and nonrandomized studiesevaluating patient-reported outcomes, health care use, and disease outcomes afterdelivery of SCPs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO,Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library.Data extracted by independent raters were summarized on the basis of qualitativesynthesis. Results Eleven nonrandomized and 13 randomized studies met inclusioncriteria. Variability was evident across studies in cancer types, SCP deliverytiming and method, SCP recipients and content, SCP-related counseling, andoutcomes assessed. Nonrandomized study findings yielded descriptive informationon satisfaction with care and reactions to SCPs. Randomized study findings weregenerally negative for the most commonly assessed outcomes (ie, physical,functional, and psychological well-being); findings were positive in singlestudies for other outcomes, including amount of information received,satisfaction with care, and physician implementation of recommended care.Conclusion Existing research provides little evidence that SCPs improve healthoutcomes and health care delivery. Possible explanations include heterogeneity instudy designs and the low likelihood that SCP delivery alone would influencedistal outcomes. Findings are limited but more positive for proximal outcomes(eg, information received) and for care delivery, particularly when SCPs areaccompanied by counseling to prepare survivors for future clinical encounters.Recommendations for future research include focusing to a greater extent onevaluating ways to ensure SCP recommendations are subsequently acted on as partof ongoing care.

Treating BL in SSA poses particular challenges.Although highly effective, high-intensity cytotoxic treatments used inresource-rich settings are usually not feasible, and lower-intensity continuousinfusion approaches are impractical. In this article, based on evidence from theregion, we review management strategies for SSA focused on diagnosis and use ofprephase and definitive treatment. Additionally, potentially better approachesfor risk stratification and individualized therapy are elaborated. Compared withhistorical very low-intensity approaches, the relative safety, feasibility, andoutcomes of regimens incorporating anthracyclines and/or high-dose systemicmethotrexate for this population are discussed, along with requirements toadminister such regimens safely. Finally, research priorities for BL in SSA areoutlined including novel therapies, to reduce the unacceptable gap in outcomesfor patients in SSA vs high-income countries (HICs). Sustained commitment toincremental advances and innovation, as in cooperative pediatric oncology groupsin HICs, is required to transform care and outcomes for BL in SSA throughinternational collaboration.

A robustlymphocytic reaction within colorectal cancers is strongly associated with bettersurvival, but whether immune response impacts the disparity in colorectal cancersurvival is unknown.Methods: The study population was comprised of 211histologically confirmed colorectal cancers at the Medical University of SouthCarolina (Charleston, SC; 159 CAs and 52 AAs) diagnosed between Jan 01, 2000, andJune 30, 2013. We constructed a lymphocyte score based on blinded pathologicassessment of the four different types of lymphocytic reactions. Cox proportionalhazards regression was used to evaluate the association between the lymphocytescore and risk of death by race.Results: Colorectal cancers in AAs (vs. CAs) hada stronger lymphocytic reaction at diagnosis. A high lymphocyte score (vs. thelowest) was associated with better survival in AAs [HR 0.19; 95% confidenceinterval (CI), 0.04-0.99] and CAs (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.15-1.45). AAs with nolymphocytic reaction (vs. other categories) had poor survival HR 4.48 (1.58-12.7)whereas no difference was observed in CAs. The risk of death in AAs (vs. CA) wasmore pronounced in younger patients (HR 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22) compared witholder (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.54-2.67), especially those with lymphocytic poorcolorectal cancers.Conclusions: The lymphocytic reaction in tumor impacted theracial disparity in survival.Impact: Our results confirm the importance of thelymphocytic score on survival and highlight the need to fully characterize theimmune environment of colorectal cancers by race.

Duringthelast decade, 4 intrinsic molecular subtypes ofbreast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched [HER2-E] and Basal-like) havebeen identified and intensively studied. In this article, we review and discussthe clinical implications of the 2 non-luminal subtypes (i.e. HER2-E andBasal-like) identified within hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease. Afterreviewing 32 studies for a total of 13,091 samples, ∼8% and ∼ 15% of early andmetastatic HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer, respectively, were found to benon-luminal. Clinically, HR+/HER2-negative/non-luminal subtypes have beenassociated with estrogen independence, chemo-sensitivity, resistance to CDK4/6inhibition and poor outcome. Interestingly, EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitionmight be of value in the HR+/HER2-negative/HER2-E subtype. Finally, the HER2-Esubtype within HR+/HER2 + disease represents ∼ 30% and has been associated withanti-HER2 sensitivity, chemo-sensitivity and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. Inthe upcoming years, retrospective and prospective clinical trials evaluating bothbiomarkers should lead to improvements in patient outcomes.^Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

However, these trials reported lower overallsurvival and lower rates of optimal debulking than U.S. studies, leading toquestions about generalizability to U.S. practice, where aggressive debulking ismore common. Consequently, comparative effectiveness in the U.S. remainscontroversial. We reviewed U.S. comparative effectiveness studies of NACT versusPDS for AOC. Here we describe methodological challenges, compare results totrials outside the U.S., and make suggestions for future research. We identifiedU.S. studies published in 2010 or later that evaluated the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS on survival in AOC through a PubMed search. Twoindependent reviewers abstracted data from eligible articles. Nine of 230articles were eligible for review. Methodological challenges included unmeasuredconfounders, heterogeneous treatment effects, treatment variations over time, andinconsistent measurement of treatment and survival. Whereas some limitations wereunavoidable, several limitations noted across studies were avoidable, includingconditioning on mediating factors and immortal time introduced by measuringsurvival beginning from diagnosis. Without trials in the U.S., non-randomizedstudies are an important source of evidence for the ideal treatment for AOC.However, several methodological challenges exist when assessing the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS in a non-randomized setting. Futureobservational studies must ensure that treatment is consistent throughout thestudy period and that treatment groups are comparable. Rapidly-evolving oncologydata networks may allow for identification of treatment intent and otherimportant confounders.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Knowledge of each is derived using clinical,histopathological, and radiological investigations. This multimodal approachreduces the risk of error from one particular test, but may present a stagingdilemma when results conflict. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)may improve patient care through imaging of the bladder with better resolution ofthe tissue planes than computed tomography and without radiation exposure.OBJECTIVE: To define a standardized approach to imaging and reporting mpMRI forBC, by developing a VI-RADS score.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We created VI-RADS (Vesical Imaging-Reporting And DataSystem) through consensus using existing literature.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We describe standard imaging protocols and reporting criteria(including size, location, multiplicity, and morphology) for bladder mpMRI. Wepropose a five-point VI-RADS score, derived using T2-weighted MRI,diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement, which suggests therisks of muscle invasion. We include sample images used to understand VI-RADS.CONCLUSIONS: We hope that VI-RADS will standardize reporting, facilitatecomparisons between patients, and in future years, will be tested and refined ifnecessary. While we do not advocate mpMRI for all patients with BC, this imagingmay compliment pathology or reduce radiation-based imaging. Bladder mpMRI may bemost useful in patients with non-muscle-invasive cancers, in expediting radicaltreatment or for determining response to bladder-sparing approaches.PATIENT SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for bladder cancer arebecoming more common and may provide accurate information that helps improvepatient care. Here, we describe a standardized reporting criterion for bladderMRI. This should improve communication between doctors and allow bettercomparisons between patients.^Copyright © 2018 European Association of Urology. All rights reserved.

Twenty-onebaseline pretreatment clinical factors were analyzed in relation to OS by theKaplan-Meier method along with log-rank tests and univariate and multivariate Coxregression analyses.RESULTS: The median OS from first RE procedure was 10.7 months (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 9.4-12.7 months). Several pretreatment factors, including lowercarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; ≤20 ng/mL), lower aspartate transaminase (AST; ≤40IU/L), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) <5, and absence of extrahepatic diseaseat baseline were associated with significantly improved OS after RE, comparedwith high CEA (>20 ng/mL), high AST (>40 IU/L), NLR ≥5, and extrahepaticmetastases (P values of <.001, <.001, .0001, and .04, respectively). Onmultivariate analysis, higher CEA, higher AST, NLR ≥5, extrahepatic disease, andlarger volume of liver metastases remained independently associated with risk ofdeath (hazard ratios of 1.63, 2.06, 2.22, 1.48, and 1.02, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with metastases from CRC is impacted by acomplex set of clinical parameters. This analysis of pretreatment factorsidentified lower AST, lower CEA, lower NLR, and lower tumor burden (intra- orextrahepatic) to be independently associated with higher survival after hepaticRE. Optimal selection of patients with CRC liver metastases may improve survivalrates after administration of yttrium-90.^Copyright © 2018 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Logistic regression models and Coxproportional hazard models were used to examine pathological variables,recurrence, and 3-year disease-free survival.RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met criteria; the mean age was 52.0 (SD: 17.7).Depth of invasion was a significant predictor of occult metastasis (OR: 2.0,p = 0.05) and lymphovascular invasion (OR: 4.1, p = 0.02), and tumor thicknesswas a significant predictor of lymphovascular invasion (OR: 3.3, p = 0.04). Noneof the variables were predictive of recurrence or disease-free survival.CONCLUSION: Depth of invasion at biopsy may be a potential useful metric toinform on regional management selection in this radiographic node-negativepopulation.^© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Three compounds (UNC10112721A, UNC10112652A, and UNC10112793A) wereidentified that inhibited the growth of MiaR cells by more than 50% (at 50 nM).Two compounds (UNC10112721A and UNC10112652A) were classified as cyclin-dependentkinase (CDK) inhibitors, whereas UNC10112793A was reported to be a PLK inhibitor.Dose-response experiments supported the efficacy of these compounds to inhibitgrowth and increase apoptosis in 2D cultures of these cells. However, onlyUNC10112721A significantly inhibited the growth of 3D spheroids composed of MiaRcells and GFP-tagged cancer-associated fibroblasts. Multiplexed inhibitor bead(MIB)-mass spectrometry (MS) kinome competition experiments identified CDK9,CLK1-4, DYRK1A, and CSNK1 as major kinase targets for UNC10112721A in MiaR cells.Another CDK9 inhibitor (CDK-IN-2) replicated the growth inhibitory effects ofUNC10112721A, whereas inhibitors against the CLK, DYRK, or CSNK1 kinases had noeffect. In summary, these studies describe a coordinated approach to discovernovel kinase inhibitors, evaluate their efficacy in 3D models, and define theirspecificity against the kinome.

Conditional survival reflects changing mortality riskwith time since cancer diagnosis and is a useful measure for planning long-termfollow-up care.METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry 9database, the authors identified a cohort of AYA patients diagnosed with a firstmalignant cancer between 1973 and 2009 and followed through 2014. They estimated5-year relative survival at the time of diagnosis and at each additional yearsurvived up to 25 years after diagnosis, conditional on the individual beingalive at the beginning of that year.RESULTS: A total of 205,954 AYA patients with cancer were identified. Thyroidcancer, melanoma, testicular cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, andcentral nervous system (CNS) tumors comprised 67% of all cancers. For all cancerscombined, 5-year relative survival was 84.5% (95% confidence interval,84.3%-84.7%) at 1 year after diagnosis and 94.0% (95% CI, 93.9%-94.2%) at 5years. The relative survival first exceeded 95%, reflecting minimal excessmortality compared with the general population, at 7 years. Patients with thyroidcancer, testicular cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer reached a relativesurvival of >95% at the time of diagnosis and at 1, 3, and 18 years afterdiagnosis, respectively. Estimates for those with Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemiawere >95% at 6 and 13 years, respectively, but declined to <95% at 20 years. AYAindividuals with CNS tumors did not reach 95% by 25 years after diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: For AYA survivors of breast cancer, CNS tumors, and hematologicmalignancies, long-term excess mortality should be considered when planningfollow-up care.

Kim, University of North Carolina LinebergerComprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC.^Purpose Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is astandard of care for the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).Dose-dense cisplatin-based regimens have yielded favorable outcomes compared withstandard-dose chemotherapy, yet the optimal neoadjuvant regimen remainsundefined. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of six cycles of neoadjuvantdose-dense gemcitabine and cisplatin (ddGC) in patients with MIBC. Patients andMethods In this prospective, multicenter phase II study, patients received ddGC(gemcitabine 2,500 mg/m2 on day 1 and cisplatin 35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2) every 2weeks for 6 cycles followed by RC. The primary end point was pathologicdownstaging to non-muscle-invasive disease (< pT2N0). Patients who did notundergo RC were deemed nonresponders. Pretreatment tumors underwentnext-generation sequencing to identify predictors of chemosensitivity. ResultsForty-nine patients were enrolled from three institutions. The primary end pointwas met, with 57% of 46 evaluable patients downstaged to < pT2N0. Pathologicresponse correlated with improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival.Nineteen patients (39%) required toxicity-related dose modifications. Sixty-sevenpercent of patients completed all six planned cycles. No patient failed toundergo RC as a result of chemotherapy-associated toxicities. The most frequenttreatment-related toxicity was anemia (12%; grade 3). The presence of a presumeddeleterious DNA damage response (DDR) gene alteration was associated withchemosensitivity (positive predictive value for < pT2N0 [89%]). No patient with adeleterious DDR gene alteration has experienced recurrence at a median follow-upof 2 years. Conclusion Six cycles of ddGC is an active, well-toleratedneoadjuvant regimen for the treatment of patients with MIBC. The presence of aputative deleterious DDR gene alteration in pretreatment tumor tissue stronglypredicted for chemosensitivity, durable response, and superior long-termsurvival.

They received treatmentwith weekly carboplatin at an area under the curve of 2, plus paclitaxel135 mg/m2 , and daily lapatinib 1000mg for 6 weeks followed by surgicalresection. Pathology that revealed margins <5 mm, extracapsular extension, N2a ofN2b lymph node status, perineural invasion, or lymphovascular space invasionresulted in adjuvant radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin. Pathologywith N2c/N3 lymph node status or positive margins resulted in radiation withbolus cisplatin. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate to inductionchemotherapy, and a key secondary endpoint was feasibility.RESULTS: Toxicity was modest, and 37 of 40 patients completed study procedures asplanned. The clinical response rate was 93%, the pathologic complete responserate was 36%, and the clinical response did not predict for a pathologic completeresponse. No patient on study follow-up has recurred or died. Twenty-nine of 39patients who underwent surgery avoided radiation. Speech and swallowing functionwere well preserved.CONCLUSIONS: The study met both its primary efficacy endpoint and the secondaryfeasibility endpoint. Neoadjuvant, systemic therapy and surgical resectionfollowed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy resulted in high response rates andexcellent long-term outcomes and should be further studied.

Viral vectors have been extensivelytested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationicpolymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfectionefficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easilytailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drivegreat efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asksif nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can findapplication niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride}(PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side withchemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed byintracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicityand fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA(PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to makeserum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In anintraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervicalcancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumorinhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gavemuch less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapydrugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed muchfewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviralvectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantagesand may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example,intraperitoneal cancer therapy.

Compared with men of other races andethnicities, African-American men have higher rates of mortality and morbidityfrom chronic illness and diseases including cancer, heart disease, prostatecancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. One way to address these disparities is to includeAfrican-American men in health research, to elicit their perspectives on healthrisks and protective factors. These can then inform interventions aimed atreducing health disparities. However, challenges remain in recruiting andengaging African-American men in health research.AIM: To provide strategies for recruiting African-American men in healthresearch, using as an exemplar a qualitative study of fathers' perspectives ofsexual health promotion with young African-American males.DISCUSSION: Efforts are needed to increase the representation of African-Americanmen in health research. Ensuring that researchers are aware of the cultural,social and environmental factors related to decisions to participate in researchcan lead to effective methods to recruit and engage them.CONCLUSION: There are several essential strategies for increasingAfrican-American men's participation in health research: ensuring the researchteam is culturally and gender-sensitive; recruiting in trusted environments;using respected gatekeepers; developing trust with participants; and beingtransparent.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Implementing strategies to include African-Americanmen in health research has the potential to improve health disparities in the US.^©2018 RCN Publishing Company Ltd.

The specificity and selectivity of bioactive peptide naturalproducts present a possible stopgap measure to address the ongoing deficit of newtherapeutic compounds. PepSAVI-MS (Statistically-guided bioActive Peptidesprioritized VIa Mass Spectrometry) is an adaptable method for the analysis ofnatural product libraries to rapidly identify bioactive peptides. This pipelinewas validated via screening of the cyclotide-rich botanical species Viola odorataand identification of the known antimicrobial and anticancer cyclotidecycloviolacin O2. Herein we present and validate novel bioactivities of theanthelmintic V. odorata cyclotide, cycloviolacin O8 (cyO8), including micromolaranticancer activity against PC-3 prostate, MDA-MB-231 breast, and OVCAR-3 ovariancancer cell lines and antifungal activity against the agricultural pathogenFusarium graminearum. A reduction/alkylation strategy in tandem with PepSAVI-MSanalysis also revealed several previously uncharacterized putatively bioactivecyclotides. Downstream implementation of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD)tandem mass spectrometry is demonstrated for cyO8 as a method to addresstraditionally difficult-to-sequence cyclotide species. This work emphasizes thetherapeutic and agricultural potential of natural product bioactive peptides andthe necessity of developing robust analytical tools to deconvolute nature'scomplexity.

KSHV ORF36, also known as viral proteinkinase (vPK), is a viral serine/threonine kinase. We previously reported thatKSHV vPK enhances cell proliferation and mimics cellular S6 kinase tophosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, a protein involved in protein synthesis. Wecreated a mouse model to analyze the function of vPK in vivo. We believe this isthe first mouse tumor model of a viral kinase encoded by a pathogenic humanvirus. We observed increased B cell activation in the vPK transgenic micecompared with normal mice. We also found that, over time, vPK transgenic micedeveloped a B cell hyperproliferative disorder and/or a high-grade B cellnon-Hodgkin lymphoma at a greatly increased incidence compared with littermatecontrols. This mouse model shows that a viral protein kinase is capable ofpromoting B cell activation and proliferation as well as augmentinglymphomagenesis in vivo and may therefore contribute to the development of viralcancers.

Women living with advanced or incurable cancer who havedependent children experience high rates of depression and anxiety as well asunique parenting challenges. To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date haveexamined the parenting factors associated with health-related quality of life(HRQOL) in women with advanced cancer.METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional, Web-based survey of thepsychosocial concerns of 224 women with a tumor-node-metastasis staging system ofthe AJCC stage IV solid tumor malignancy who had at least 1 child aged <18 years.Participants completed validated measures of HRQOL (Functional Assessment ofCancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]); depression and anxiety symptom severity;functional status; parenting concerns; and investigator-designed questions toassess demographic, communication, and parenting characteristics. Multiple linearregression models were estimated to identify factors associated with FACT-G totaland subscale scores.RESULTS: The mean FACT-G score was 66 (standard deviation, 16). The meanEmotional Well-Being subscale scores were particularly low (13; standarddeviation, 5). In multivariable linear regression models, parenting variablesexplained nearly 40% of the HRQOL model variance. In the fully adjusted model,parenting concerns and the absence of parental prognostic communication withchildren both were found to be significantly associated with HRQOL scores. Foreach 1-point increase in parenting concern severity, FACT-G scores decreased by 4points (P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: Women with metastatic cancer who are parents of dependent childrenare at risk of high psychological distress and low HRQOL.

The objective of thisstudy was to create a process for sustainable engagement for researchprioritization within oncology.METHODS: From December 2014 to 2016, a network of engaged patients for researchprioritization was created in partnership with the Bladder Cancer AdvocacyNetwork (BCAN): the BCAN Patient Survey Network (PSN). The PSN leveraged anonline bladder cancer community with additional recruitment through printadvertisements and social media campaigns. Prioritized research questions weredeveloped through a modified Delphi process and were iterated throughmultidisciplinary working groups and a repeat survey.RESULTS: In year 1 of the PSN, 354 patients and caregivers responded to theresearch prioritization survey; the number of responses increased to 1034 in year2. The majority of respondents had non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),and the mean time since diagnosis was 5 years. Stakeholder-identified questionsfor noninvasive, invasive, and metastatic disease were prioritized by the PSN.Free-text questions were sorted with thematic mapping. Several questionssubmitted by respondents were among the prioritized research questions. A finalprioritized list of research questions was disseminated to various fundingagencies, and a highly ranked NMIBC research question was included as a priorityarea in the 2017 Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute announcement ofpragmatic trial funding.CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement is needed to identify high-priority researchquestions in oncology.

Kimryn.Rathmell@Vanderbilt.Edu.(#)Contributed equally^Loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) occurs early in >95% of clear cellrenal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nearly ubiquitous 3p loss in ccRCC suggestshaploinsufficiency for 3p tumor suppressors as early drivers of tumorigenesis. Wepreviously reported methyltransferase SETD2, which trimethylates H3 histones onlysine 36 (H3K36me3) and is located in the 3p deletion, to also trimethylatemicrotubules on lysine 40 (αTubK40me3) during mitosis, with αTubK40me3 requiredfor genomic stability. We now show that monoallelic, Setd2-deficient cellsretaining H3K36me3, but not αTubK40me3, exhibit a dramatic increase in mitoticdefects and micronuclei count, with increased viability compared with biallelicloss. In SETD2-inactivated human kidney cells, rescue with a pathogenic SETD2mutant deficient for microtubule (αTubK40me3), but not histone (H3K36me3)methylation, replicated this phenotype. Genomic instability (micronuclei) wasalso a hallmark of patient-derived cells from ccRCC. These data show that theSETD2 tumor suppressor displays a haploinsufficiency phenotype disproportionatelyimpacting microtubule methylation and serves as an early driver of genomicinstability.Significance: Loss of a single allele of a chromatin modifier plays arole in promoting oncogenesis, underscoring the growing relevance of tumorsuppressor haploinsufficiency in tumorigenesis.

LRF was defined as recurrence at the ipsilateral lung,bronchial stump, mediastinum, chest wall, or supraclavicular region. TheKaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to LRF, with patients censored atdeath, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons. A two-sided p value of lessthan 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS: Included were 217 patients (median age, 65 years). Preoperative stagingwith positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed in 89% ofpatients, mediastinoscopy was performed in 42%, and video-assisted thoracoscopicsurgery was performed in 51%. At a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 1 to 120months), the 5-year estimated LRF was 26% (95% confidence interval, 20% to 35%).LRF rates were not significantly different in those with and without stagingpositron emission tomography/computed tomography (hazard ratio, 1.52; p = 0.43)and those with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy(hazard ratio, 1.00; p = 0.99).CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary staging procedures and surgical techniques forearly-stage NSCLC, LRF occurs in approximately 1 of 4 patients. The observedrates of LRF are similar to those reported more than a decade ago, suggestingthat local/regional control remains a persistent problem. The use of additionallocal treatments, such as radiotherapy, should be reevaluated to further improveoutcomes.^Copyright © 2018 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hubbard, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.^Purpose The aim of the current study was to characterize the risk of intervalinvasive second breast cancers within 5 years of primary breast cancer treatment.Methods We examined 65,084 surveillance mammograms from 18,366 women with aprimary breast cancer diagnosis of unilateral ductal carcinoma in situ or stage Ito III invasive breast carcinoma performed from 1996 to 2012 in the Breast CancerSurveillance Consortium. Interval invasive breast cancer was defined asipsilateral or contralateral cancer diagnosed within 1 year after a negativesurveillance mammogram. Discrete-time survival models-adjusted for allcovariates-were used to estimate the probability of interval invasive cancer,given the risk factors for each surveillance round, and aggregated across roundsto estimate the 5-year cumulative probability of interval invasive cancer.Results We observed 474 surveillance-detected cancers-334 invasive and 140 ductalcarcinoma in situ-and 186 interval invasive cancers which yielded a cancerdetection rate of 7.3 per 1,000 examinations (95% CI, 6.6 to 8.0) and an intervalinvasive cancer rate of 2.9 per 1,000 examinations (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.3). Mediancumulative 5-year interval cancer risk was 1.4% (interquartile range, 0.8% to2.3%; 10th to 90th percentile range, 0.5% to 3.7%), and 15% of women had ≥ 3%5-year interval invasive cancer risk. Cumulative 5-year interval cancer risk washighest for women with estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negativeprimary breast cancer (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.7% to 3.5%), interval cancer presentationat primary diagnosis (2.2%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 2.9%), and breast conservationwithout radiation (1.8%; 95% CI, 1.1% to 2.4%). Conclusion Risk of intervalinvasive second breast cancer varies across women and is influenced bycharacteristics that can be measured at initial diagnosis, treatment, andimaging. Risk prediction models that evaluate the risk of cancers not detected bysurveillance mammography should be developed to inform discussions of tailoredsurveillance.

We examined the effect of statin use on risk of prostatecancer progression in a population-based, minority-enriched cohort.METHODS: We used data from prostate cancer cases (45% African American) diagnosedbetween 2004 and 2007 who participated in the Health Care Access and ProstateCancer Treatment in North Carolina cohort (HCaP-NC). We abstracted statin use atdiagnosis. Men reported if they had ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol.Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine associationsbetween statin use and risk of prostate cancer progression (biochemicalrecurrence or secondary treatment), overall and by race. In secondary analysis,we examined the association between high cholesterol and risk of progression,overall, and by statin use.RESULTS: Of 669 men, 244 (36%) were statin users at diagnosis. During 3.8 yearsmedian follow-up, 138 men experienced prostate cancer progression. There was noassociation between statin use and risk of progression, either overall (HR 1.03;95%CI 0.72-1.46) or stratified by race. High cholesterol was inversely associatedwith risk of progression, particularly among statin users (HR 0.43; 95%CI0.20-0.94; p-interaction = 0.22) and in men with higher perceived access to care(HR 0.57; 95%CI 0.36-0.90; p-interaction = 0.03). Study limitations included arelatively small sample size, short follow-up, and lack of data regarding postdiagnosis statin use.CONCLUSIONS: Statin use at diagnosis was not associated with prostate cancerprogression in the population-based, minority-enriched HCaP-NC. Greaterhealthcare engagement, including actively controlling serum cholesterol, may belinked to better prostate cancer-specific outcomes.^© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Toxicities and responses wereevaluated with CTCAE.4 and IWG-2006 criteria, respectively. We also performedimmunologic assays and T-cell receptor sequencing on serial samples.Results:Twenty-nine patients from 7 centers were enrolled. In the initial DL1 (3 mg), 3of 6 patients experienced grade 2-4 immune-related adverse events (IRAE) thatwere reversible with drug discontinuation and/or systemic steroids. In DL2, 4 of5 patients experienced grade 2 or higher IRAE; thus, DL1 (3 mg/kg) was expandedwith no grade 2-4 IRAEs reported in 18 additional patients. Best responsesincluded marrow complete response (mCR) in one patient (3.4%). Prolonged stabledisease (PSD) for ≥46 weeks occurred in 7 patients (24% of entire cohort and 29%of those treated with 3 mg/kg dose), including 3 patients with more than a yearof SD. Five patients underwent allografting without excessive toxicity. Mediansurvival for the group was 294 days (95% CI, 240-671+). Patients who achieved PSDor mCR had significantly higher frequency of T cells expressing ICOS (inducibleT-cell co-stimulator).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ipilimumab dosed at3 mg/kg in patients with MDS after HMA failure is safe but has limited efficacyas a monotherapy. Increased frequency of ICOS-expressing T cells might predictclinical benefit. Clin Cancer Res; 24(15); 3519-27. ©2018 AACR.^©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

Our purposeis to summarize the use of endometrial ablation devices, potential short-term andlong-term complications, cost effectiveness, and quality of life in relation toalternative treatments.RECENT FINDINGS: There is insufficient evidence to strongly recommend oneendometrial ablation device over another. Providers should consider and discusswith their patients, complications including risk of future pregnancy,endometrial cancer, and hysterectomy for continued bleeding or pain. Patientselection is key to reducing postablation pain and failure; patients with ahistory of tubal ligation and dysmenorrhea should consider alternativetreatments. All patients should also be counseled that the levonorgestrelintrauterine device is a cost-effective alternative with higher quality of lifeand fewer complications. Hysterectomy is definitive treatment with higher qualityof life and fewer complications.SUMMARY: Although endometrial ablation can offer adequate symptom control forpatients who have failed medical therapy, desire uterine preservation, or who arehigh-risk surgical candidates, patients should be appropriately selected andcounseled regarding the potential for treatment failure and long-termcomplications.

We demonstrate that tumor-secreted protein S (Pros1), aMer/Tyro3 ligand, decreased macrophage M1 cytokine expression in vitro and invivo. In contrast, tumor cells with CRISPR-based deletion of Pros1 failed toinhibit M1 polarization. Tumor cell-associated Pros1 action was abrogated inmacrophages from Mer- and Tyro3- but not Axl-KO mice. In addition, several othermurine and human tumor cell lines suppressed macrophage M1 cytokine expressioninduced by IFN-γ and LPS. Investigation of the suppressive pathway demonstrated arole for PTP1b complexing with Mer. Substantiating the role of PTP1b, M1 cytokinesuppression was also lost in macrophages from PTP1b-KO mice. Mice bearingPros1-deficient tumors showed increased innate and adaptive immune infiltration,as well as increased median survival. TAM activation can also inhibitTLR-mediated M1 polarization. Treatment with resiquimod, a TLR7/8 agonist, didnot improve survival in mice bearing Pros1-secreting tumors but doubled survivalfor Pros1-deleted tumors. The tumor-derived Pros1 immune suppressive system, likePD-L1, was cytokine responsive, with IFN-γ inducing Pros1 transcription andsecretion. Inhibition of Pros1/TAM interaction represents a potential novelstrategy to block tumor-derived immune suppression.

This study aims to develop and validate a model of factors associatedwith prior falls among older adults with cancer.METHODS: In this cross-sectional secondary analysis, two cohorts of patients aged≥ 65 with cancer were examined to develop and validate a model of factorsassociated with falls in the prior 6 months. Potential independent variables,including demographic and laboratory data and a geriatric assessment(encompassing comorbidities, functional status, physical performance,medications, and psychosocial status), were identified. A multivariate model wasdeveloped in the derivation cohort using an exhaustive modeling approach. Themodel selected for validation offered a low Akaike Information Criteria value andincluded dichotomized variables for ease of clinical use. This model was thenapplied in the validation cohort.RESULTS: The development cohort (N = 498) had a mean age of 73 (range 65-91).Nearly one-fifth (18.2%) reported a fall in the prior 6 months. The selectedmodel comprised nine variables involving functional status, objective physicalperformance, depression, medications, and renal function. The AUC of the modelwas 0.72 (95% confidence intervals 0.65-0.78). In the validation cohort(N = 250), the prevalence of prior falls was 23.6%. The AUC of the model in thevalidation cohort was 0.62 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.71).CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed and validated a model of factorsassociated with prior falls in older adults with cancer. Future study is neededto examine the utility of such a model in prospectively predicting incidentfalls.

Electronic address: xiongyang@zcmu.edu.cn.^In order to explore the mechanism of the reversing multidrug resistance (MDR)phenotypes by β-elemene (β-ELE) in doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant breast cancercells (MCF-7/DOX), both the functionality and quantity of the ABC transporters inMCF-7/DOX were studied. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to study theefflux of d-luciferin potassium salt, the substrate of ATP-binding cassettetransporters (ABC transporters), in MCF-7/DOX cells treated by β-ELE. At the sametime three major ABC transport proteins and genes-related MDR, P-glycoprotein(P-gp, ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP, ABCC1) as wellas breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) were analyzed by q-PCR andWestern blot. To investigate the efflux functionality of ABC transporters,MCF-7/DOXFluc cell line with stably-overexpressed luciferase was established. BLIwas then used to real-time monitor the efflux kinetics of d-luciferin potassiumsalt before and after MCF-7/DOXFluc cells being treated with β-ELE or not. Theresults showed that the efflux of d-luciferin potassium salt from MCF-7/DOXFlucwas lessened when pretreated with β-ELE, which means that β-ELE may dampen thefunctionality of ABC transporters, thus decrease the efflux of d-fluoresceinpotassium or other chemotherapies which also serve as the substrates of ABCtransporters. As the effect of β-ELE on the expression of ABC transporters, theresults of q-PCR and Western blot showed that gene and protein expression of ABCtransporters such as P-gp, MRP, and BCRP were down-regulated after the treatmentof β-ELE. To verify the efficacy of β-ELE on reversing MDR, MCF-7/DOX cells weretreated with the combination of DOX and β-ELE. MTT assay showed that β-ELEincreased the inhibitory effect of DOX on the proliferation of MCF-7/DOX, and theIC50 of the combination group was much lower than that of the single DOX or β-ELEtreatment. In all, β-ELE may reverse MDR through the substrates of ABCtransporters by two ways, to lessen the ABC protein efflux by weakening theirfunctionality, or to reduce the quantity of ABC gene and protein expression.^Copyright © 2018.

Incident thyroid cancer (n = 108) was ascertained through 2008. Controlswere matched 2:1 by age, date of blood draw, gender, and county. We used gaschromatography/mass spectrometry to quantify 36 PCB congeners and metabolites ofpesticides DDT, chlordane, hexachlorocyclohexane, and hexachlorobenzene. PCBs andpesticide metabolites were evaluated individually and summed by degree ofchlorination and parent compound, respectively. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) were computed using conditional logistic regression perspecified increase in lipid-adjusted concentration. We additionally stratifiedanalyses by birth cohort (1923-1932, 1933-1942, 1943-1957).RESULTS: Increasing concentration of DDT metabolites (ORper 1000 ng/g = 0.80,95%CI = 0.66-0.98) was inversely associated with thyroid cancer. Associations forPCBs were null or in inverse direction. We observed interactions for total PCBs,moderately-chlorinated PCBs, and chlordane metabolites with birth cohort(p ≤ 0.04). Among participants born 1943-1957, total PCBs (ORper 100 ng/g = 1.25,95%CI = 1.00-1.56), moderately-chlorinated PCBs (ORper 100 ng/g = 1.31, 95%CI =1.01-1.70), and chlordane metabolites (ORper 10 ng/g = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.09-2.93)were positively associated with thyroid cancer. For individuals born before 1943,associations were generally null or in the inverse direction.CONCLUSIONS: Emissions of PCBs and OC pesticides varied over time. Different riskpatterns by birth cohort suggest the potential importance of timing of exposurein thyroid cancer risk. Further evaluation of these associations is warranted.^Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite the intenseresearch efforts in developing new nanoparticles and surface bonding ligands, onemajor obstacle in achieving highly effective treatment, including minimizingdetrimental side effects, is the inability to deliver drug-carrying nanoparticlesfrom the injection point directly to the tumor site. The present study seeks toemploy a direct nanodrug delivery methodology to feed multifunctionalnanoparticles directly to tumor vasculatures, sparing healthy tissue. Animportant aspect to examine is how the interactions between such nanoparticlesand relatively large red blood cells would affect the transport and deliveryefficiency of nanodrugs. So, a novel computer simulation model has been developedto study nanoparticle transport in a representative human hepatic artery system,subject to shear-induced diffusion of nanoparticles due to hydrodynamicinteractions with red blood cells. The particle-size effect was also evaluated bycomparing the dynamics of nanoparticles with microspheres. Results from computersimulations under physiologically realistic conditions indicate thatshear-induced diffusion has a significant effect on nanoparticle transport, evenin large arteries. Nevertheless, as documented, direct nanodrug delivery totumor-feeding hepatic artery branches is feasible.

China.(4)School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, P. R.China.^Combination immunotherapy has recently emerged as a powerful cancer treatmentstrategy. A promising treatment approach utilizes coadministration ofantagonistic antibodies to block checkpoint inhibitor receptors, such asantiprogrammed cell death-1 (aPD1), alongside agonistic antibodies to activatecostimulatory receptors, such as antitumor necrosis factor receptor superfamilymember 4 (aOX40). Optimal T-cell activation is achieved when bothimmunomodulatory agents simultaneously engage T-cells and promote synergisticproactivation signaling. However, standard administration of these therapeuticsas free antibodies results in suboptimal T-cell binding events, with only asubset of the T-cells binding to both aPD1 and aOX40. Here, it is shown thatprecise spatiotemporal codelivery of aPD1 and aOX40 using nanoparticles (NP)(dual immunotherapy nanoparticles, DINP) results in improved T-cell activation,enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and increased immunological memory. It isdemonstrated that DINP elicits higher rates of T-cell activation in vitro thanfree antibodies.

Tryptophanmetabolism represents an immune checkpoint, and targeting this pathway'srate-limiting enzyme IDO1 is actively being investigated clinically. Here, westudied the intermediary metabolism of tryptophan metabolism in glioblastoma andevaluated the activity of the IDO1 inhibitor GDC-0919, both alone and incombination with radiation (RT).Experimental Design: LC/GC-MS and expressionprofiling was performed for metabolomic and genomic analyses of patient-derivedglioma. Immunocompetent mice were injected orthotopically with geneticallyengineered murine glioma cells and treated with GDC-0919 alone or combined withRT. Flow cytometry was performed on isolated tumors to determine immuneconsequences of individual treatments.Results: Integrated cross-platform analysescoupling global metabolomic and gene expression profiling identified aberranttryptophan metabolism as a metabolic node specific to the mesenchymal andclassical subtypes of glioblastoma. GDC-0919 demonstrated potent inhibition ofthis node and effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier. Although GDC-0919 as asingle agent did not demonstrate antitumor activity, it had a strong potentialfor enhancing RT response in glioblastoma, which was further augmented with ahypofractionated regimen. RT response in glioblastoma involves immunestimulation, reflected by increases in activated and cytotoxic T cells, which wasbalanced by immune checkpoint reactivation, reflected by an increase in IDO1expression and regulatory T cells (Treg). GDC-0919 mitigated RT-induced Tregs andenhanced T-cell activation.Conclusions: Tryptophan metabolism represents ametabolic node in glioblastoma, and combining RT with IDO1 inhibition enhancestherapeutic response by mitigating RT-induced immunosuppression.

We measured serrated polyp detection rate(SPDR) in a large, multicenter, cross-sectional study of colonoscopy quality toidentify drivers of SPDR variation.METHODS:  Colonoscopy and pathology reports were collected for a 2-year period(10/2013-9/2015) from four sites across the United States. Data from reports,including size, location, and histology of polyps, were abstracted using avalidated natural language processing algorithm. SPDR was defined as theproportion of colonoscopies with ≥ 1 serrated polyp (not including hyperplasticpolyps). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine endoscopistcharacteristics associated with serrated polyp detection.RESULTS:  A total of 104 618 colonoscopies were performed by 201 endoscopists whovaried with respect to specialty (86 % were gastroenterologists), sex (18 %female), years in practice (range 1 - 51), and number of colonoscopies performedduring the study period (range 30 - 2654). The overall mean SPDR was 5.1 % (SD3.8 %, range 0 - 18.8 %). In multivariable analysis, gastroenterology specialtytraining (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.33 - 2.70), feweryears in practice (≤ 9 years vs. ≥ 27 years: OR 1.52, 95 %CI 1.14 - 2.04)], andhigher procedure volumes (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR 1.77, 95 %CI1.27 - 2.46)] were independently associated with serrated polyp detection.CONCLUSIONS:  Gastroenterology specialization, more recent completion oftraining, and greater procedure volume are associated with serrated polypdetection. These findings imply that both repetition and training are likely tobe important contributors to adequate detection of these important cancerprecursors. Additional efforts to improve SPDR are needed.^© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

Radiation-induced fibrosis is a side effect of radiation therapy and mayoccur in up to 13% of the cases in patients (Radiother Oncol, 2009;90:80),fortunately usually is modest/localized and not associated with marked symptoms.However, occasionally, fibrosis can be moderate-to-severe, and causeclinically-meaningful symptoms. The current review summarizes the use ofpentoxifylline and vitamin E of treatment or prevention of radiation-inducedfibrosis in breast cancer patients. Even though data are limited, this regimenmay reduce RT-associated toxicity.

The aim of our study was to compare the stool microbiome ofMoroccan cancer patients with healthy individuals. We analyzed the microbiomecomposition of samples from 11 CRC patients and 12 healthy individuals by 16SrRNA amplicon sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis of samples revealeddefined cancer versus healthy clusters. Our findings showed that cancer sampleshad higher proportions of Firmicutes (T = 50.5%; N = 28.4%; p = 0.04),specifically of Clostridia (T = 48.3%; N = 19.0%; p = 0.002), and Fusobacteria(T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; p = 0.02), especially of Fusobacteriia (T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%;p = 0.02), while Bacteroidetes were enriched in healthy samples (T = 35.1%;N = 62.8%; p = 0.06), particularly the class Bacteroidia (T = 35.1%; N = 62.6%;p = 0.06). Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Selenomonas, andFusobacterium were significantly overrepresented in diseased patients, similarlyto other studies. Predicted functional information showed that bacterial motilityproteins, flagellar assembly, and fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism weresignificantly overrepresented in cancer patients, while amino acid metabolism andglycan biosynthesis were overrepresented in controls. This suggests thatinvolvement of these functional metagenomes is similar and relevant in thecarcinogenesis process, independent of the origin of the samples. Results fromthis study allowed identification of bacterial taxa relevant to the Moroccanpopulation and encourages larger studies to facilitate population-directedtherapeutic approaches.

Due to previous reports of a high rate of adverseevent when used long-term, concerns have been raised with regard to the use ofself-expandable metal stents in patients with a longer survival.AIM: assess the role of esophageal self-expandable metal stents in patients withadvanced esophageal cancer that have survived longer than six months.METHODS: retrospective study of patients with advanced esophageal cancer with aself-expandable metal stent and a stent placement time greater than six months.RESULTS: forty-two patients were followed up for 298 days. There was a clinicalimprovement in all patients. However, 59% of patients experienced an adverseevent. The median stent patency was 236 days. Endoscopic management was attemptedin all self-expandable metal related adverse events, with a clinical success rateof 100%. However, the previously treated adverse event recurred in sevenpatients. Multivariate analysis showed that strictures that were traversable withan ultrathin gastroscope were associated with a higher risk of adverse events (p= 0.035).CONCLUSIONS: long-term esophageal stenting in patients with advanced esophagealcancer is associated with a high prevalence of adverse events without an impacton mortality; most cases can be managed endoscopically.

Generalizability of existing trial results has been criticizedbecause of less aggressive debulking procedures than commonly used in the UnitedStates. As a result, economic evaluations using input data from these trials maynot accurately reflect costs and outcomes associated with more aggressive primarysurgery. Using data from an ongoing trial performing aggressive debulking, weinvestigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of NACT versus PDS for AEOC.METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to estimate differences inshort-term outcomes and costs for a hypothetical cohort of 15,000 AEOC patients(US annual incidence of AEOC) treated with NACT versus PDS over a 1-year timehorizon from a Medicare payer perspective. Outcomes included costs percancer-related death averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)gained. Base-case probabilities, costs, and utilities were based on the SurgicalComplications Related to Primary or Interval Debulking in Ovarian Neoplasmstrial. Base-case analyses assumed equivalent survival; threshold analysisestimated the maximum survival difference that would result in NACT beingcost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds.Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize model uncertainty.RESULTS: Compared with PDS, NACT was associated with $142 million in costsavings, 1098 fewer cancer-related deaths, and 1355 life-years and 1715 QALYsgained, making it the dominant treatment strategy for all outcomes. Insensitivity analysis, NACT remained dominant in 99.3% of simulations. Neoadjuvantchemotherapy remained cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALYwillingness-to-pay thresholds if survival differences were less than 2.7 and 1.4months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, NACT is cost-saving with improved outcomes.However, if PDS provides a longer-term survival advantage, it may becost-effective. Research is needed on the role of patient preferences intradeoffs between survival and quality of life.

Overall,one third felt that >50% of clinical trial enrollees should be age ≥65, and 64.9%felt the Alliance could improve upon enrollment of older patients. The four mostcommonly ranked strategies to improve enrollment of older patients were creatingmore dedicated trials for this population (36.3%), minimizing exclusion criteriafocused on comorbidity (35.5%), developing independent strategies for those aged≥65 and for those aged ≥70 (33.2%), and requiring that most/all Alliance trialshave a specific expansion cohort of older patients (30.0%).CONCLUSION: We anticipate that the recommendations from >1,000 Alliance memberswill continue to propel important strategy changes aimed to improve accrual ofolder patients with cancer to clinical trials.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This survey of the Alliance for Clinical Trialsmembership sought opinions on potential, large-scale, national strategies toimprove accrual of older adults with cancer.

Electronic address:Chadi.nabhan@cardinalhealth.com.^OBJECTIVE: Older patients with cancer suffer from chemotherapy-related toxicitiesmore frequently than younger patients. As novel agents are being used morecommonly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),toxicities of these agents in older patients have not been well studied. Further,impact of these toxicities on outcomes in the elderly is unknown. This studyaimed to answer both questions.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 14 Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncologytrials that enrolled CLL and/or NHL patients between 2004-2014. Toxicity wasassessed per the NCI-CTCAE (version 3-5). Probabilities of experiencing gradethree or four hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were modeled as afunction of clinical and disease-related factors using logistic regression.RESULTS: 1199 patients (409 age ≥ 65; 790 age < 65) were analyzed; 438 receivedonly biologic therapy (145 age ≥ 65; 293 age < 65), and 761 receivedbiologic + chemotherapy (264 age ≥ 65; 497 age < 65). The odds of grade three orfour hematologic [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; p = 0.009: 95% CI (1.57-1.84)] andnon-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.47; p = 0.022; 95% CI (1.39-1.55)] wereincreased in older patients with CLL, as well as odds of grade three or fournon-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.89; p = 0.017; 95% CI (1.64-2.17)] in olderpatients with NHL. Grade three or four hematologic toxicities were associatedwith inferior OS and PFS in older patients with NHL [HR 3.14; p = 0.006; 95% CI(2.25-4.39) for OS and 3.06; p = 0.011; 95% CI (2.10-4.45) for PFS], though notin CLL. A prognostic model predicting grade three or four toxicities was alsodeveloped.CONCLUSIONS: CLL and NHL patients ≥ 65 year encounter more toxicities thanyounger patients even when treated with novel biologic agents. Development ofgrade three or four hematologic toxicities lead to inferior PFS and OS in NHL butnot in CLL.

Differencesin PSA screening are largely, but not entirely, responsible. We examinedgeographic differences in prevalence of histologic prostate inflammation andsubsequent prostate cancer risk.Methods: Seven thousand nonHispanic white menwere enrolled in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE)trial from Europe (n = 4,644), North America (n = 1,746), South America (n =466), and Australia/New Zealand (n = 144). Histologic inflammation in baselinenegative prostate biopsies was classified as chronic (lymphocytes/macrophages) oracute (neutrophils). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examineassociations between region and prostate inflammation, and between region andprostate cancer risk at 2-year biopsy.Results: Prevalence of prostateinflammation varied across region, with broadly similar patterns for acute andchronic inflammation. Relative to Europe, prevalence of acute inflammation washigher in North America [odds ratio (OR), 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.51-2.08] and Australia/New Zealand (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.40-3.06). Men fromthese regions had lower prostate cancer risk than Europeans at biopsy. AmongNorth Americans, prevalence of acute inflammation was higher in Canada versus theUnited States (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), but prostate cancer risk did notdiffer between these regions. Among Europeans, prevalence of acute inflammationwas lower in Northern and Eastern (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97 and OR 0.62; 95%CI, 0.45-0.87, respectively), relative to Western Europe, and these men hadhigher prostate cancer risk at biopsy.Conclusions: Prevalence of histologicprostate inflammation varied by region. Geographic differences in prostateinflammation tracked inversely with geographic differences in prostate cancerrisk.Impact: Characterization of premalignant prostate biology and therelationship with subsequent prostate cancer risk could inform prostate cancerprevention efforts.

We describeracial differences with regard to the financial impact of breast cancer in alarge population-based prospective cohort study. Methods The Carolina BreastCancer Study oversampled black women and women younger than age 50 years withincident breast cancer in North Carolina from 2008 to 2013. Participants providedmedical records and data regarding demographics, socioeconomic status, andfinancial impact of cancer at 5 and 25 months postdiagnosis. We report unadjustedand adjusted financial impact at 25 months postdiagnosis by race. Results Thesample included 2,494 women who completed follow-up surveys (49% black, 51%white). Since diagnosis, 58% of black women reported any adverse financial impactof cancer ( v 39% of white women; P < .001). In models adjusted for age, stage atdiagnosis, and treatment received, black women were more likely to report adversefinancial impact attributable to cancer (adjusted risk difference [aRD], +14percentage points; P < .001), including income loss (aRD, +10 percentage points;P < .001), health care-related financial barriers (aRD, +10 percentage points; P< .001), health care-related transportation barriers (aRD, +10 percentage points;P < .001), job loss (aRD, 6 percentage points; P < .001), and loss of healthinsurance (aRD, +3 percentage points; P < .001). The effect of race wasattenuated when socioeconomic factors were included but remained significant forjob loss, transportation barriers, income loss, and overall financial impact.Conclusion Compared with white women, black women with breast cancer experience asignificantly worse financial impact. Disproportionate financial strain maycontribute to higher stress, lower treatment compliance, and worse outcomes byrace. Policies that help to limit the effect of cancer-related financial strainare needed.

The study purpose was to examine the effects of acute exercise oncirculating cortisol, epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrationsduring PCa treatment with and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Menwith PCa (n = 11), with PCa on ADT (n = 11), and with non-cancer controls (n = 8)had blood samples for stress hormones collected before and immediately (0 hour),2 hours, and 24 hours after 45 minutes of intermittent cycling at 60% of peakwattage. NE increased by 385% (P < .001) at 0 hour and remained elevated at2 hours (P < .05) with no group differences. Overall, cortisol significantlyincreased at 0 hour (36%, P < .012) and then significantly decreased belowbaseline at 2 hours (-24%, P < .001) before returning to resting levels at24 hours. Cortisol levels during ADT were 32% lower than PCa (P = .006) with nodifferences vs controls. Epi increased immediately after exercise more incontrols (817%, P < .001) than with ADT (700%) and PCa (333%) patients, and bothcancer groups' absolute levels were attenuated relative to controls (ADT: -54%,PCa: -52%, P = .004). Compared with age-matched controls, PCa and ADT patientsexhibited similar stress hormone responses with acute exercise for NE andcortisol but an attenuated EPI response that suggests altered adrenal function.Future studies should examine the physical stress of multiple exercise bouts toverify these findings and to explore the functional hormonal effects, such asimmune and metabolic responses, during cancer treatment.^© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Like HPV, Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) is a common pathogen with the capacity to promote epithelial neoplasms. Weexamined the association between cervical EBV, hrHPV, and cytology in female sexworkers in Nairobi, Kenya.METHODS: Women (n = 332) with known cervical cytology and hrHPV mRNA results wereevaluated for cervical EBV DNA by conventional polymerase chain reaction.Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated to assess the relationships between EBV,hrHPV, and cervical cytology. Prospective analyses used risk ratios andtime-to-event analyses to determine the association of EBV with hrHPV clearanceand with abnormal cytology outcomes.RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of hrHPV and EBV was 29% and 19%, respectively.Higher EBV prevalence was found among women with older age, HIV, hrHPV, abnormalcytology, Mycoplasma genitalium infection, smoking habits, younger age at sexualdebut, and less frequent condom use. At baseline, women with EBV had a higherprevalence of hrHPV infection than did EBV-negative women (52% vs. 24%;HIV-adjusted PR [95% confidence interval], 1.8 [1.3-2.6]). Epstein-Barrvirus-positive women had a higher prevalence than did EBV-negative women ofhigh-grade precancer (15% vs. 2%) and abnormal cytology (37% vs. 15%), althoughHIV- and hrHPV-adjusted associations were not significant (high-grade precancer:PR, 2.0 [0.7-5.9]; abnormal cytology: PR, 1.4 [0.9-2.2]). In prospectiveanalyses, a marginal association was observed between baseline EBV detection anddelayed hrHPV clearance.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible role for EBV as a high-risk marker orcofactor for HPV-mediated cervical cancer development.

Theauthors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to theirsymptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristicsassociated with each HRQOL profile.METHODS: Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures 3 months aftertreatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sexsatisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted forcovariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.RESULTS: One-third of the 373 men were not non-Hispanic white (26% were black).Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the "best HRQOL" were lesslikely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second bestprofile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reportedpoor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receivetherapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poorfunctioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increasedcomorbidity. The "worst HRQOL" group experienced the worst symptoms and thepoorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have morecomorbidities, and to smoke.CONCLUSIONS: LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experiencevery different HRQOL impact. Understanding the factors most associated withpoorer HRQOL allows clinicians to focus their care on individuals most in need ofsymptom management and support.

The efficacy of HPV vaccines in this population is unknown.Methods: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assignedHIV-infected adults aged ≥27 years to the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18)vaccine or placebo (1:1) stratified by sex and presence of anal high-gradesquamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy (bHSIL). The primary endpoint wasvaccine efficacy against incident persistent anal infection with quadrivalentvaccine types or single detection at the final visit that were not present atbaseline. Secondary endpoints included vaccine efficacy for anal bHSIL after week52, persistent oral HPV infection.Results: A total of 575 participants were randomized. The Data and SafetyMonitoring Board stopped the study early due to futility. Vaccine efficacy was22% (95.1% confidence interval [CI], -31%, 53%) for prevention of persistent analinfection or single detection at the final visit, 0% (95% CI -44%, 31%) forimproving bHSIL outcomes and 88% (95.1% CI 2%, 98%) for preventing persistentoral HPV infection, but was 32% (95.1% CI -80%, 74%) for 6-month persistent oralHPV infection or single detection at the final visit.Conclusions: These results do not support HPV vaccination of HIV-infected adultsaged ≥27 years to prevent new anal HPV infections or to improve anal HSILoutcomes. However, our data suggest a role for prevention of oral HPV infections,but this finding should be confirmed in future studies.Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01461096.

This paperreports countywide adoption, reach, and effectiveness from the Faith, Activity,and Nutrition dissemination and implementation study.DESIGN: This was a group-randomized trial. Data were collected in 2016.Statistical analyses were conducted in 2017.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Churches in a rural, medically underserved county in SouthCarolina were invited to enroll, and attendees of enrolled churches were invitedto complete questionnaires (n=1,308 participated).INTERVENTION: Churches (n=59) were randomized to an intervention or control(delayed intervention) condition. Church committees attended training focused oncreating opportunities, setting guidelines/policies, sharing messages, andengaging pastors for physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE). Churchesalso received 12 months of telephone-based technical assistance. Community healthadvisors provided the training and technical assistance.MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption,Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework guided measurement of adoption andreach. To assess effectiveness, church attendees completed post-test onlyquestionnaires of perceptions of church environment, PA and fruit and vegetable(FV) self-efficacy, FV intake, and PA. Regression models controlled for churchclustering and predominant race of congregation, as well as member age, gender,education, and self-reported cancer diagnosis.RESULTS: Church adoption was 42% (55/132). Estimated reach was 3,527,representing 42% of regular church attendees and 15% of county residents.Intervention church attendees reported greater church-level PA opportunities, PAand HE messages, and PA and HE pastor support (p<0.0001), but not FVopportunities (p=0.07). PA self-efficacy (p=0.07) and FV self-efficacy (p=0.21)were not significantly higher in attendees of intervention versus controlchurches. The proportion of inactive attendees was lower in intervention versuscontrol churches (p=0.02). The proportion meeting FV (p=0.27) and PA guidelines(p=0.32) did not differ by group.CONCLUSIONS: This innovative dissemination and implementation study had highadoption and reach with favorable environmental impacts, positioning it forbroader dissemination.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.govNCT02868866.^Copyright © 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

We evaluated an in-house EV-TF activity assay (the fibringeneration test) for the prediction of cancer-associated VTE. We also comparedthe results with the fibrin generation tests to an EV-TF-dependent factor Xageneration assay in samples from pancreatic cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in a multinational, prospective cohortstudy were used. Patients with various types of advanced cancer were enrolled ifchemotherapy was scheduled or started in the previous 3 months. Patients werefollowed for 6 months for the occurrence of VTE. The fibrin generation test wasperformed at baseline to measure EV-TF procoagulant activity.RESULTS: The fibrin generation test was performed in 648 patients with advancedcancer. The mean age was 62 years; 58% had distant metastasis. Forty patients(6.1%) developed VTE. Overall, a high fibrin generation test result wasassociated with a two-fold increased risk for VTE (HR 2.0; 95%-CI, 1.1-3.6). Theassociation was stronger in patients with pancreatic cancer (HR 4.1; 95%-CI,0.91-19) than in those with other tumor types (HR 1.5; 95%-CI, 0.72-3.1).Correlation between the FGT and the TF-dependent factor Xa generation assay inpatients with pancreatic cancer was poor (Spearman's R = 0.35).CONCLUSION: This study shows that a high EV-TF procoagulant activity as measuredby the fibrin generation test is associated with an increased risk of VTE incancer patients, in particular in those with pancreatic cancer. Future studiesshould aim to further improve the feasibility and accuracy of EV-TF activityassays.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electronic address:nshaheen@med.unc.edu.^BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) recurs in 25% or more of patientstreated successfully with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), so surveillanceendoscopy is recommended after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia(CEIM). The frequency of surveillance is informed only by expert opinion. Weaimed to model the incidence of neoplastic recurrence, validate the model in anindependent cohort, and propose evidence-based surveillance intervals.METHODS: We collected data from the United States Radiofrequency AblationRegistry (US RFA, 2004-2013) and the United Kingdom National Halo Registry (UKNHR, 2007-2015) to build and validate models to predict the incidence ofneoplasia recurrence after initially successful RFA. We developed 3 categories ofrisk and modeled intervals to yield 0.1% risk of recurrence with invasiveadenocarcinoma. We fit Cox proportional hazards models assessing discriminationby C statistic and 95% confidence limits.RESULTS: The incidence of neoplastic recurrence was associated with most severehistologic grade before CEIM, age, endoscopic mucosal resection, sex, andbaseline BE segment length. In multivariate analysis, a model based solely onmost severe pre-CEIM histology predicted neoplastic recurrence with a C statisticof 0.892 (95% confidence limit, 0.863-0.921) in the US RFA registry. This modelalso performed well when we used data from the UK NHR. Our model divided patientsinto 3 risk groups based on baseline histologic grade: non-dysplastic BE;indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia; orintramucosal adenocarcinoma. For patients with low-grade dysplasia, we proposesurveillance endoscopy at 1 and 3 years after CEIM; for patients with high-gradedysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma, we propose surveillance endoscopy at0.25, 0.5, and 1 year after CEIM, then annually.CONCLUSION: In analyses of data from the US RFA and UK NHR for BE, amuch-attenuated schedule of surveillance endoscopy would provide protection frominvasive adenocarcinoma. Adherence to the recommended surveillance intervalscould decrease the number of endoscopies performed yet identify unresectablecancers at rates less than 1/1000 endoscopies.^Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

We selected each beneficiary'sfirst eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during therespective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3 years for fixed look-back;180 days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. Weestimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (HRs) forthe effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect)and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using eachlook-back.RESULTS: Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated HR from the all-availableapproach (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-yearlook-back (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries withprevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.21) wassomewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due theexclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuousenrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). Allapproaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality.Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding.CONCLUSIONS: The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-yearfixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs areinfeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferableto short (1-year) fixed look-backs.^Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Curiously, large-scaleanalyses of a variety of cancers showed that increased expression of MMR proteinsoften correlated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and early recurrence. Tobetter understand these observations, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas and GeneExpression across Normal and Tumor tissue databases to analyze MMR proteinexpression in cancers. We found that the MMR genes MSH2 and MSH6 areoverexpressed more frequently than MSH3, and that MSH2 and MSH6 are oftencooverexpressed as a result of copy number amplifications of these genes. Theseobservations encouraged us to test the effects of upregulating MMR protein levelsin baker's yeast, where we can sensitively monitor genome instability phenotypesassociated with cancer initiation and progression. Msh6 overexpression (two- tofourfold) almost completely disrupted mechanisms that prevent recombinationbetween divergent DNA sequences by interacting with the DNA polymeraseprocessivity clamp PCNA and by sequestering the Sgs1 helicase. Importantly,cooverexpression of Msh2 and Msh6 (∼eightfold) conferred, in a PCNAinteraction-dependent manner, several genome instability phenotypes includingincreased mutation rate, increased sensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitorHU and the DNA-damaging agents MMS and 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, and elevatedloss-of-heterozygosity. Msh2 and Msh6 cooverexpression also altered the cellcycle distribution of exponentially growing cells, resulting in an increasedfraction of unbudded cells, consistent with a larger percentage of cells in G1.These novel observations suggested that overexpression of MSH factors affectedthe integrity of the DNA replication fork, causing genome instability phenotypesthat could be important for promoting cancer progression.^Copyright © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.

A barrier to long-term treatment withsunitinib includes the development of significant adverse effects, includingdiarrhea, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and fatigue. This trial assessed the effectof an alternate 2 weeks on, 1 week off (2/1) schedule of sunitinib on toxicityand efficacy in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cellcarcinoma. Methods Patients started with oral administration of 50 mg sunitinibon a 2/1 schedule and underwent schedule and dose alterations if toxicitydeveloped. The primary end point was < 15% grade ≥ 3 fatigue, diarrhea, or HFS.With 60 patients, the upper bound of the CI would fall below the published 4/2schedule grade ≥ 3 toxicity rate of 25% to 30%. Results Fifty-nine patients weretreated between August 2014 and March 2016. Seventy-seven percent wereintermediate or poor risk per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria.With a median follow-up of 17 months, 25% of patients experienced grade 3fatigue, HFS, or diarrhea; 37% required a dose reduction, and 10% discontinuedbecause of toxicity. The overall response rate was 57%, median progression-freesurvival was 13.7 months, and median overall survival was not reached. At 12weeks, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores dropped between 0%and 10% from baseline, with less reduction in patients who continued treatmentlonger. Conclusion The primary end point of decreased grade 3 toxicity was notmet; however, treatment with a 2/1 sunitinib schedule is associated with a lackof grade 4 toxicity, a low patient discontinuation rate, and high efficacy.

In this phase Ib trial we evaluated the safety, tolerability,and preliminary antitumor activity of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab inadvanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and performancestatus 0 or 1 were treated with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin area underthe curve 6 once every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, with concurrent bavituximab(0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg) intravenously weekly, using a standard 3+3 design. At themaximum identified dose, additional patients were enrolled to furthercharacterize the safety profile. The primary objective was to characterize thesafety, determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and establish therecommended phase II dose of bavituximab in combination with pemetrexed andcarboplatin in incurable stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC.RESULTS: Between March 29, 2011 and December 30, 2013, 26 patients were enrolled.Three patients each were enrolled into dose escalation cohorts of bavituximab(0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). Therapy was well tolerated with no DLTs, and toxicitieswere consistent with those expected from pemetrexed/carboplatin. Overall responsewas 28%, with a median progression-free and overall survival of 4.8 months and12.2 months, respectively.CONCLUSION: The combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab is welltolerated. However, with toxicities and preliminary efficacy signal similar topemetrexed/carboplatin alone, further studies of bavituximab should focus on waysto enhance its immunomodulatory role.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report that NP co-delivery of cisplatin (CP) andwortmannin (Wtmn), a DNA repair inhibitor, synergistically enhanceschemoradiotherapy (CRT) and reverses CP resistance in PROC. We encapsulated thisregimen in FDA approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)(PLGA-PEG) NPs to reduce systemic side effects, enhance cellular CP uptake,improve Wtmn stability, and increase therapeutic efficacy. Treatment ofplatinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) and PROC murine models with thesedual-drug loaded NPs (DNPs) significantly reduced tumor burden versus treatmentwith combinations of free drugs or single-drug loaded NPs (SNPs). These resultssupport further investigation of this NP-based, synergistic drug regimen as ameans to combat PROC in the clinic.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These cancersgenerally have poor clinical characteristics compared with screen-detectedcancers, but associations between interval cancer and genomic cancercharacteristics are not well understood. Mammographically screened womendiagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from 1993 to 2013 (n = 370) wereidentified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the CarolinaMammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram0 to 24 months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N =165) or interval-detected (N = 205). Using logistic regression, we examined theassociation of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, andgenomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race.Interval cancer was associated with large tumors [>2 cm; OR, 2.3; 95% confidenceinterval (CI), 1.5-3.7], positive nodal status (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8), andtriple-negative subtype (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.5). Interval cancers were morelikely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), whereasscreen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (96% had low risk ofrecurrence genomic scores; 71% were PAM50 Luminal A). When stratifying bymammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poorprognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associationsbetween interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal Asubtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biologyis an important contributor to interval cancer rates.

Electronic address:yangy@email.unc.edu.^OBJECTIVES: Previous research has reported associations between socialrelationships and carcinogenesis. Inflammation is a potential mediator of theseassociations. To clarify these links for one tumor site, we examined associationsbetween social relationships, circulating inflammation markers, and breast cancerincidence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 132,262 participants from the prospective Women'sHealth Initiative, we used linear and logistic regression to evaluateassociations between social relationship characteristics (social support, socialstrain, social network size) and inflammation markers of C-reactive protein (CRP)and white blood cell count (WBC). Cox regression was used to evaluateassociations between inflammation markers and breast cancer incidence, as well asassociations between social relationship characteristics and breast cancerincidence with and without adjustment for inflammation markers.RESULTS: Larger social networks were associated with lower continuous CRP(beta = -0.22, 95% CI -0.36, -0.08) and WBC (beta = -0.23, 95% CI -0.31, -0.16).Greater social strain was associated with higher continuous CRP (beta = 0.24, 95%CI 0.14, 0.33) and WBC (beta = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04, 0.14). When WBC wasdichotomized at 10,000 cells/uL, high WBC was associated with greater hazards ofin situ breast cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.17, 2.33) but not invasive breastcancer. Social relationship characteristics were not associated with incidence ofinvasive or in situ breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Larger social networks were associated with lower inflammation andgreater social strain was associated with higher inflammation. Higherinflammation might be associated with development of in situ breast cancer, butthis appeared to be due to factors other than social relationships.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated TTF based on age.METHODS: Pooled analyses were conducted with first-line chemotherapy trials foradvanced NSCLC (CALGB 9730, 30203, and 30801). Comparisons among patients whowere 65 years and older and 70 years and older were performed for TTF (primaryendpoint), reasons for early chemotherapy cessation, grade 3+ adverse events, andoverall survival.RESULTS: Among 1006 patients, 460 (46%) were older than 65 years of age. Onehundred forty-five older patients (32% of this age cohort) completed all sixplanned chemotherapy cycles as did 170 (32%) younger patients. Median TTF was 2.9months (95% confidence interval: 2.7- 3.2) in older patients and 3 months (95%confidence interval: 2.9-3.5) in younger patients; adjustment for performancestatus and stratification by chemotherapy by trial yielded no statisticallysignificant age-based difference in TTF. However, reasons for early chemotherapycessation differed between age groups (multivariate p = 0.004). Older patientswere less likely to discontinue from cancer progression (41% versus 55%) and morelikely from toxicity or patient choice (16% and 15%, respectively) compared toyounger patients (13% and 6%, respectively). Older patients were more likely toexperience grade 3+ adverse events (86% versus 79%) with no statisticallysignificant difference in survival. An age cutpoint of 70+ years showed nodifference in TTF, a lower trend of early cessation due to cancer progression,and somewhat shorter older patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: TTF was comparable between older and younger patients; butdifferent, age-based, and potentially modifiable reasons account for it.^Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.Published by Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, we estimated the putative efficacy of three biomarkers toselect patients for NAC: DNA-repair gene panel [ataxia telangiectasia mutated(ATM), retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), and Fanconi anaemia complementation group C(FANCC)], excision repair cross-complementation group 2 (ERCC2), and ribonucleicacid (RNA) subtypes. A decision analysis model was developed to evaluate thecost-effectiveness of biomarker-based approaches to select patients with MIBC forNAC. Comparison of cost-effectiveness included RC alone, unselected NAC plus RC,and NAC based on the three aforementioned biomarkers.RESULTS: The DNA-repair gene panel-based approach to NAC was the mostcost-effective strategy (mean OS of 3.14 years, $31 482/life year). Under thisapproach, 38% would undergo NAC, about twice the number of patients who arecurrently receiving NAC for MIBC. Such an approach would improve mean OS by 5.2,1.6, and 4.4 months compared to RC alone, a hypothetical scenario where allpatients received NAC, and compared to current estimates of NAC utilisation,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: A biomarker-based strategy to identify patients with MIBC who shouldundergo NAC was more cost-effective than unselected use of NAC or RC alone. Asfurther data becomes available, such a model may serve as a basis forincorporating biomarkers into clinical decision making.^© 2018 The Authors BJU International © 2018 BJU International Published by JohnWiley & Sons Ltd.

One major hurdle that exists is inadequatedrug delivery due to the desmoplastic stroma and poor vascularization that ischaracteristic of pancreatic cancer. The local iontophoretic delivery ofchemotherapies provides a novel way of improving treatment. With the growingpractice of highly toxic combination therapies in the treatment of pancreaticcancer, the use of iontophoresis for local delivery can potentiate theanti-cancer effects of these therapies while sparing unwanted toxicity. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the impact of formulation on theelectro-transport of the FOLFIRINOX regimen for the development of a newtreatment for pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Three formulations of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil,leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) were generated at a fixed pH of 6.0 andwere referred to as formulation A (single drug solution with all four drugscombined), formulation B (two drug solutions with two drugs per solution), andformulation C (four individual drug solutions). Anodic iontophoresis of the threedifferent formulations was evaluated in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts ofpancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Iontophoretic transport of the FOLFIRINOX drugs was characterizedaccording to organ exposure after a single device treatment in vivo. We reportthat the co-iontophoresis of two drug solutions, leucovorin + oxaliplatin and5-fluorouracil + irinotecan, resulted in the highest levels of cytotoxic drugs inthe tumor compared to drugs delivered individually or combined into one solution.There was no significant difference in plasma, pancreas, kidney, and liverexposure to the cytotoxic drugs delivered by the three different formulations. Inaddition, we found that reducing the duration of iontophoretic treatment from 10to 5 min per solution resulted in a significant decrease in drug concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Underlying the difference in drug transport of the formulations waselectrolyte concentrations, which includes both active and inactive components.Electrolyte concentrations can hinder or improve drug electro-transport. Overall,balancing electrolyte concentration is needed for optimal electro-transport.

This study assessed salivary gland FNA results and risk of malignancy(ROM) rates at the University of North Carolina as well as the interobserverreliability (IOR) of the atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and salivarygland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (SUMP) categories.METHODS: The electronic medical record was searched for FNA cases from 2010 to2017 with subsequent surgical resections. Histologic diagnosis was used forgold-standard comparison. The original cytologic results were then converted intoMSRSGC categories (nondiagnostic, nonneoplastic, AUS, benign neoplasm, SUMP,suspicious, and malignant). For the assessment of IOR, 23 cases were selectedwith enrichment for cases diagnosed as AUS (n = 11) or SUMP (n = 9). Six boardedcytopathologists and 1 cytopathology fellow assessed representative slides andprovided an MSRSGC diagnosis for each case. Fleiss' κ coefficients werecalculated to determine IOR.RESULTS: The ROM was 33% for both AUS and SUMP cases; however, the risk ofneoplasia was 56% for AUS cases and 100% for SUMP cases. Fleiss' κ for the AUScategory was 0.217 (P < .05), and Fleiss' κ for the SUMP category was 0.024 (P =.74).CONCLUSIONS: In this study assessing the IOR of MSRSGC categories, fair agreementand slight agreement were found for the AUS and SUMP categories, respectively.Observers preferentially used the AUS or benign neoplasm category for SUMP cases,perhaps because of unfamiliarity with SUMP as a diagnostic option. The initialadoption of a new reporting system will require a quality assessment to ensurethat the system is reliable and useful for clinicians.

The primary studyendpoint was the pathologic complete response rate based on biopsy of the primarysite and dissection of pretreatment positive lymph node regions. The pathologiccomplete response rate as previously reported was 86%. Herein, the authors reportsecondary endpoint measures of local control, regional control, cause-specificsurvival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival, andpatient-reported outcomes (European Organization for Research and Treatment ofCancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and thePatient-Reported Outcomes version of Common Terminology Criteria for AdverseEvents [PRO-CTCAE]).RESULTS: A total of 44 patients enrolled with a median follow-up of 36 months(88% with ≥2 years). The 3-year local control, regional control, cause-specificsurvival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rates were 100%,100%, 100%, 100%, and 95%, respectively. The mean before and 3-year after EORTCQOL scores were: global: 80 of 78; swallowing: 11 of 11; dry mouth: 16 of 41; andsticky saliva: 6 of 29. The mean before and 3-year after PRO-CTCAE scores were:swallowing: 0.4 of 0.7; and dry mouth: 0.4 of 1.4. Approximately 39% of patientsrequired a feeding tube (median duration, 15 weeks; none were permanent). Therewere no ≥grade 3 late adverse events reported.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with favorable-risk human papillomavirus-associatedoropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a substantially decreased intensity oftherapy with 60 grays of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and weekly low-dosecisplatin produced better preservation of quality of life compared with standardtherapies while maintaining excellent 3-year tumor control and survival.

Single-center studies have reportedinferior outcomes in patients with a complex karyotype (CK), but this remains anarea of controversy.METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 483 patients from 5 academiccenters in the United States and described the effect of a CK on survivaloutcomes in individuals with MCL.RESULTS: A CK was found to be associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (4.5vs 11.6 years; P<.01) and progression-free survival (PFS) (1.9 vs 4.4 years;P<.01). In patients who underwent high-intensity induction followed by autologousstem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first remission, a CK was associated withpoor OS (5.1 vs 11.6 years; P = .04) and PFS (3.6 vs 7.8 years; P<.01). Amongpatients with a CK, high-intensity induction had no effect on OS (4.5 vs 3.8years; P = .77) nor PFS (2.3 vs 1.5 years; P = .46). Similarly, ASCT in firstremission did not improve PFS (3.5 vs 1.2 years; P = .12) nor OS (5.1 vs 4.0years; P = .27). On multivariable analyses with Ki-67 and MIPI, only CK was foundto be predictive of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.12-3.49 [P = .02]), whereas both CK (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17-3.12 [P =.01]) and Ki-67 >30% (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.06-3.28 [P = .03]) were associated withinferior PFS. Multivariable analysis did not identify any specific cytogeneticabnormalities associated with inferior survival.CONCLUSIONS: CK appears to be independently associated with inferior outcomes inpatients with MCL regardless of the intensity of induction therapy and receipt ofASCT. Cytogenetics should be incorporated into the workup of a new diagnosis ofMCL and novel therapeutic approaches should be investigated for patients with CK.Cancer 2018;124:2306-15. © 2018 American Cancer Society.^© 2018 American Cancer Society.

Average number of prescriptions receivedper patient was 4.8 (range, 1 to 31), over an average of 9.5 months (range, 1.2to 28.1 mo). Mean morphine milligram equivalents prescribed per prescription was319 mg (range, 48 to 2475 mg). According to multivariate model, patients whoreceived chemotherapy (OR, 7.25; 95% CI, 2.09-25.17; P=0.0018), or pain-modifyingmedications (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.25-9.44; P<0.0001) were significantly morelikely to continue to receive prescriptions for opioids.DISCUSSION: Treatment with chemotherapy, pain-modifying medications, cancerstage, and interval between diagnosis and treatment are the best predictors forcontinuous opioid use. The current epidemic of opioid misuse and abuse makesexamination current practices and identifification of areas of improvementimperative.

To facilitate the transition from activetreatment to follow-up care for the 15.5 million US cancer survivors, manyorganizations require SCP use. However, results of several RCTs of SCPs'effectiveness have been null, possibly because they have evaluated outcomes onwhich SCPs should be expected to have limited influence. Stakeholders (e.g.,survivors, oncologists) may expect outcomes that differ from RCTs' outcomes.METHODS: We identified RCTs' outcomes using a PubMed literature review. Weidentified outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs using semistructuredinterviews with stakeholders in three healthcare systems in the USA and Canada.Finally, we mapped RCTs' outcomes onto stakeholder-identified outcomes.RESULTS: RCT outcomes did not fully address outcomes that stakeholders expectedfrom SCPs, and RCTs assessed outcomes that stakeholders did not expect from SCPs.RCTs often assessed outcomes only from survivors' perspectives.CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have not assessed outcomes thatstakeholders expect. To better understand SCPs' effectiveness, future RCTs shouldassess outcomes of SCP use that are relevant from the perspective of multiplestakeholders.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: SCPs' effectiveness may be optimized when usedwith an eye toward outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs. For survivors,this means using SCPs as a map to guide them with respect to what kind offollow-up care they should seek, when they should seek it, and from whom theyshould seek it.

In response, we sought todetermine the prevalence of specific comorbidities and frailty among AYAs (15-39years old at diagnosis) enrolled in a cancer survivorship cohort.METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey of a tertiary medical center-based cancersurvivorship cohort, we determined the prevalence of specific comorbidities andfrailty using the survey-based FRAIL assessment. In separate models adjusting forage, we estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) for the associations between patientcharacteristics and (1) any comorbidity and (2) frailty or prefrailty usinglog-binomial models.RESULTS: We identified 271 AYA cancer survivors, most of whom were 30-39 yearsold at survey (57%). A majority of survivors (n = 163, 60%) reported having atleast one comorbidity with the most common being depression (28%), anxiety (27%),asthma (17%), high cholesterol (15%), and hypertension (15%). Of the 184 AYAsurvivors at least 1 year from cancer diagnosis, 19 (10%) were classified asfrail and 39 (21%) as prefrail. Survivors who were smokers (PR 2.0, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-3.56); obese (PR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.10-2.55);uninsured (PR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.63-4.59); or who reported comorbid depression oranxiety (PR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.51-3.67) were more likely to be frail or prefrail.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of frailty and comorbidities is high among AYA cancersurvivors suggestive of accelerated aging.

BCC wasconfirmed by blinded review of pathology reports.RESULTS: One hundred and four of 958 non-Hispanic white participants werediagnosed with BCC over a median follow-up of 13·5 years. Cumulative incidence ofBCC was 12% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7-17] for placebo, 16% (95% CI 11-21)for 81 mg aspirin daily and 15% (95% CI 10-20) for 325 mg aspirin daily [hazardratio (HR) for any aspirin 1·45 (95% CI 0·93-2·26); HR for 81 mg daily 1·57 (95%CI 0·96-2·56); HR for 325 mg daily 1·33 (95% CI 0·80-2·20)]. BCC risk was higherwith aspirin use in those without previous skin cancer but lower with aspirin usein those with previous skin cancer (Pinteraction = 0·02 for 81 mg aspirin daily;Pinteraction = 0·03 for 325 mg aspirin daily). Folic acid supplementation wasunrelated to BCC incidence (HR 0·85; 95% CI 0·57-1·27).CONCLUSIONS: Neither aspirin nor folic acid treatment had a statisticallysignificant effect on risk of BCC.

Our objective was toevaluate effect of differential distance on cystectomy receipt among patientswith muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and investigate the associationbetween travel distance and cystectomy outcomes such as readmission.METHODS: Using a linked data resource combining the NC Central Cancer Registrywith claims data from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance plans, weincluded 736 patients with MIBC and 1,082 who underwent cystectomy. To evaluateaccess, differential distance was calculated as the difference between thenearest urologist and nearest cystectomy provider. To assess outcomes, logisticregression was used to evaluate rehospitalization and major complications, andCox proportional hazards model for survival analysis.RESULTS: To evaluate access and outcomes, 736 patients with MIBC and 1,082patients undergoing cystectomy were evaluated, respectively. Overall, 29% (211 of736) with MIBC underwent cystectomy. Differential distance was not a predictor ofcystectomy receipt (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01). Among patientsundergoing cystectomy, travel distance from cystectomy provider was not asignificant predictor of 30- or 31 to 90day readmissions (odds ratio = 1.0; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.00) although patients who lived further from their cystectomyprovider were more likely to be readmitted to a nonindex hospital (P<0.001) whencontrolling for other factors. Although travel distance did not have asignificant effect on overall survival, patients readmitted between 31 to 90dayshad worse overall survival (P<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The additional distance needed to reach a cystectomy provider didnot predict receipt of surgery for MIBC. Furthermore, travel distance fromcystectomy provider was not a significant predictor for subsequent readmissionafter cystectomy and did not affect overall survival.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic address:aaron.thrift@bcm.edu.^BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified morethan 20 susceptibility loci for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and Barrett'sesophagus (BE). However, variants in these loci account for a small fraction ofcases of EA and BE. Genetic factors might interact with environmental factors toaffect risk of EA and BE. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) that may modify the associations of body mass index (BMI), smoking, andgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with risks of EA and BE.METHODS: We collected data on single BMI measurements, smoking status, andsymptoms of GERD from 2284 patients with EA, 3104 patients with BE, and 2182healthy individuals (controls) participating in the Barrett's and EsophagealAdenocarcinoma Consortium GWAS, the UK Barrett's Esophagus Gene Study, and the UKStomach and Oesophageal Cancer Study. We analyzed 993,501 SNPs in DNA samples ofall study subjects. We used standard case-control logistic regression to test forgene-environment interactions.RESULTS: For EA, rs13429103 at chromosome 2p25.1, near the RNF144A-LOC339788gene, showed a borderline significant interaction with smoking status (P =2.18×10-7). Ever smoking was associated with an almost 12-fold increase in riskof EA among individuals with rs13429103-AA genotype (odds ratio=11.82; 95% CI,4.03-34.67). Three SNPs (rs12465911, rs2341926, rs13396805) at chromosome 2q23.3,near the RND3-RBM43 gene, interacted with GERD symptoms (P = 1.70×10-7, P =1.83×10-7, and P = 3.58×10-7, respectively) to affect risk of EA. For BE,rs491603 at chromosome 1p34.3, near the EIF2C3 gene, and rs11631094 at chromosome15q14, at the SLC12A6 gene, interacted with BMI (P = 4.44×10-7) and pack-years ofsmoking history (P = 2.82×10-7), respectively.CONCLUSION: The associations of BMI, smoking, and GERD symptoms with risks of EAand BE appear to vary with SNPs at chromosomes 1, 2, and 15.

We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.ExperimentalDesign: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as 4 to 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized withaEpCAM, aHER-2, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all 24cancer patients enrolled. Multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimersfurther improved capture sensitivity. We also showed that cell rolling effect canimprove CTC capture specificity (% of captured cells that are CK+/CD45-/DAPI+) upto 38%. Among the 18 patients with sequential CTC measurements, the median CTCdecreased from 113 CTCs/mL before radiotherapy to 32 CTCs/mL at completion ofradiotherapy (P = 0.001). CTCs declined throughout radiotherapy in patients withcomplete clinical and/or radiographic response, in contrast with an elevation inCTCs at mid or post-radiotherapy in the two patients with known pathologicresidual disease.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that multivalent binding andcell rolling can improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC capture comparedwith multivalent binding alone, allowing reliable monitoring of CTC changesduring and after treatment.

In this analysis of 349 newly diagnosed SCCHN patients and 295cancer-free controls, we investigated whether expression levels of eight core NERproteins were associated with risk of SCCHN. We quantified NER protein expressionlevels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes using a reverse-phase proteinmicroarray. Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statisticallysignificantly lower expression levels of ERCC3 and XPA (P = 0.001 and 0.001,respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values ofexpression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increasedrisk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC3 (adjusted OR, 1.75, and 95% CI:1.26-2.42; Ptrend  = 0.008) and XPA (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60;Ptrend  = 0.001). We also identified a significant multiplicative interactionbetween smoking status and ERCC3 expression levels (P = 0.014). Finally, afterintegrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition ofERCC3 and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved thesensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced proteinexpression levels of ERCC3 and XPA were associated with an increased risk ofSCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies.^© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BCSC clinical and registry data were linked toMedicare claims and enrollment data. We estimated the cumulative probability ofbreast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We tested the association ofpreoperative MRI with all-cause mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: 917 (20.6%) women underwent preoperative MRI. No significant differencein the cumulative probability of breast cancer-specific mortality was found. Weobserved no significant difference in the hazard of all-cause mortality duringthe follow-up period after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factorsamong women with MRI (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.72-1.12) compared to those without MRI.CONCLUSION: Our findings of no breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortalitybenefit supplement prior results that indicate a lack of improvement in surgicaloutcomes associated with use of preoperative MRI. In combination with otherreports, the results of this analysis highlight the importance of exploring thebenefit of preoperative MRI in patient-reported outcomes such as women's decisionquality and confidence levels with decisions involving treatment choices.

Two trained raters coded 104recorded videos of port starts from 43 children being treated for cancer. Thisincluded 25 children with two video-recorded port starts and 18 children withthree (T1, T2, T3). The Parent Caring Response Scoring System derived fromSwanson's Caring Theory was used to code parent communication behaviors as caringresponses during their children's port starts. Three 3- to 5-minute slices(pre-port start, during, and post-port start) were coded for each video. Mixedmodeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used toanalyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between T1 versus T3 in eye contact(β = -1.05, p = .02), distance-close-enough-to-touch (β = -0.81, p = .03),nonverbal comforting (β = -1.34, p = .04), and availability (β = -0.92, p =.036), suggesting that more parents used communication behaviors at T3 comparedwith T1. Parent burdensome or intrusive questions (e.g., Why do you cry? β =-1.11, p = .03) and nonverbal comforting (β = -1.52, p = .047) increased from T2to T3. The median values of parent communication behaviors overall had nosignificant changes from T1 to T3.CONCLUSION: Parents adjusted to use more nonverbal caring behaviors as theirchild experienced additional port starts.

We exploreddifferential methylation of imprinted gene regulatory regions as predictors ofthe risk of CIN1 regression. A total of 164 patients with CIN1 were recruitedfrom 10 Duke University clinics for the CIN Cohort Study. Participants hadcolposcopies at enrollment and up to five follow-up visits over 3 years. DNA wasextracted from exfoliated cervical cells for methylation quantitation at CpG(cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Coxregression to quantify the effect of methylation on CIN1 regression over twoconsecutive visits, compared to non-regression (persistent CIN1; progression toCIN2+; or CIN1 regression at a single time-point), adjusting for age, race,high-risk HPV (hrHPV), parity, oral contraceptive and smoking status. Medianparticipant age was 26.6 years (range: 21.0-64.4 years), 39% wereAfrican-American, and 11% were current smokers. Most participants werehrHPV-positive at enrollment (80.5%). Over one-third of cases regressed (n = 53,35.1%). Median time-to-regression was 12.6 months (range: 4.5-24.0 months).Probability of CIN1 regression was negatively correlated with methylation atIGF2AS CpG 5 (HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.23-0.77) and PEG10 DMR (HR = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.65-0.98). Altered methylation of imprinted IGF2AS and PEG10 DMRs may playa role in the natural history of CIN1. If confirmed in larger studies, furtherresearch on imprinted gene DMR methylation is warranted to determine its efficacyas a biomarker for cervical cancer screening.^© 2018 UICC.

The average age for the autologous repair was11.6 years with 56% male versus 40.7 years with 56% male for the osseointegratedimplant patients. For autologous patients, indications for surgery wereanotia/microtia in 8/9 (89%) and trauma in 1/9 (11%) versus 6/16 (387.5%)anotia/microtia, 8/16 (50%) cancer, and 2/16 (132.5%) trauma in theosseointegrated implant group. The mean number of surgeries was 3.1 forautologous repairs and 1.0 for osseointegrated repairs (mean differenceconfidence interval [CI]: -2.4 to -1.8, P < .001). The average cost to thehospital for an osseointegrated repair was $6,491.39 versus $10,047.93 forautologous repairs (CI: $6,496.38 to $-616.68, P = .02) CONCLUSIONS:Osseointegrated implants for retaining an auricular prosthesis has a similar costto autologous repair of ear defects, but patients underwent an average of twomore surgeries with autologous repair. Patients should be able to choose thereconstruction option that best suits their condition and preferences.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

Due to the complex nature ofOM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathwaysassociated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publiclyavailable data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targetingthe relevant OM molecular pathways.METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated genes were determined by text mining,and the intersection of the two gene sets was selected for gene ontology analysisusing the GeneCodis program. Protein interaction network analysis was performedusing STRING-db. Enriched gene sets belonging to the identified pathways werequeried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates fortopical use in OM.RESULTS: Our analysis identified 447 genes common to both the "OM" and "woundhealing" text mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded 20 genesrepresenting six pathways and targetable by a total of 32 drugs which couldpossibly be formulated for topical application. A manual search onClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no relevant pathway/drug candidate had beenoverlooked. Twenty-five of the 32 drugs can directly affect the PTGS2 (COX-2)pathway, the pathway that has been targeted in previous clinical trials withlimited success.CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery using in silico text mining and pathway analysistools can facilitate the identification of existing drugs that have the potentialof topical administration to improve OM treatment.

We also sought to identify heterogeneity in therelationship between sleep disturbance and exercise.METHODS: Data were obtained from the MY-Health study, a community-basedobservational study of adults diagnosed with cancer. Patient-Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System® (PROMIS) measures (e.g., PROMIS Sleep) wereadministered, and participants self-reported demographics, comorbidities, cancertreatment, and exercise. Regression mixture and multiple regression models wereused to evaluate the relationship between sleep disturbance and exercisecross-sectionally at an average of 10 months after diagnosis, and the change insleep disturbance over a 7-month period, from approximately 10 to 17 monthspost-diagnosis.RESULTS: Patients whose exercise was categorized as likely at or above AmericanCollege of Sports Medicine's guidelines did not report statistically better sleepquality compared to patients who were classified as not active. However,retirement (B = - 2.4), anxiety (B = 0.21), and fatigue (B = 0.24) hadstatistically significant relationships with sleep disturbance (p < 0.05).Increase in exercise was not significantly associated with a decrease in sleepdisturbance. No statistical heterogeneity was revealed in the relationshipbetween sleep and exercise.CONCLUSIONS: Further prospective research using an objective measure of exerciseis warranted to confirm or refute the nature of the relationship between exerciseand sleep disturbance in individuals diagnosed with CRC transitioning offfirst-line treatment.

These agents offer limitedefficacy with substantial toxicity. The development of novel immune checkpointinhibitors has challenged the standard treatment. Pembrolizumab is a potent andhighly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interactionbetween PD-1, an immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and -2. InAugust 2016, the US FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC followingdisease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This reviewhighlights the pharmacology, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability data relevantto the use of pembrolizumab for the treatment of R/M HNSCC. Readers will gaingreater insight into the HNSCC tumor microenvironment, available biomarkers, andlearn about important clinical considerations associated with the use ofpembrolizumab and similar immune checkpoint inhibitors.

However, intraindividual variability in epithelialinvolution status within a woman is undefined. We developed a novel measure ofage-related epithelial involution, density of epithelial nuclei in epithelialareas using digital image analysis in combination with stromal characteristics(percentage of section area comprising stroma). Approximately 1800 hematoxylinand eosin stained sections of benign breast tissue were evaluated from 416participants having breast surgery for cancer or benign conditions. Two tosixteen slides per woman from different regions of the breast were studied.Epithelial involution status varied within a woman and as a function of stromalarea. Percentage stromal area varied between samples from the same woman (mediandifference between highest and lowest stromal area within a woman was 7.5%, butranged from 0.01 to 86.7%). Restricting to women with at least 10% stromal area(N = 317), epithelial nuclear density decreased with age (-637.1 cells/mm2 perdecade of life after age 40, p < 0.0001), increased with mammographic density(457.8 cells/mm2 per increasing BI-RADs density category p = 0.002), andincreased non-significantly with recent parity, later age at first pregnancy, andlonger and more recent oral contraceptive use. These associations were attenuatedin women with mostly fat samples (<10% stroma (N = 99)). Thirty-one percent ofwomen evaluated had both adequate stroma (≥10%) and mostly fat (<10% stroma)regions of breast tissue, with the probability of having both types increasingwith the number breast tissue samplings. Several breast cancer risk factors areassociated with elevated age-related epithelial content, but associations dependupon stromal context. Stromal characteristics appear to modify relationshipsbetween risk factor exposures and breast epithelial involution.

Higher odds of CRA wereobserved among individuals with an affected mother (OR = 1.27; 95%CI = 1.05-1.53) or sibling (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.11-1.62) as compared with thosewithout, whereas no association was shown for individuals with an affectedfather. Odds of having a metachronous CRA increased with number of affected FDRs,with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.07 (0.93-1.23) for one relative and 1.39 (1.02-1.91) fortwo or more. Younger age of diagnosis of a sibling was associated with higherodds of metachronous CRA, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.66 (1.08-2.56) for diagnosis at<54 years; 1.34 (0.89-2.03) for 55-64 years; and 1.10 (0.70-1.72) for >65 years(p-trend = 0.008). Although limited by sample size, results for advancedmetachronous CRA were similar to those for any metachronous CRA.CONCLUSIONS: A family history of CRC is related to a modestly increased odds ofmetachronous CRA. Future research should explore whether having a FDR with CRC,particularly at a young age, should have a role in risk stratification forsurveillance colonoscopy.

Electronic address: Iyer.Prasad@mayo.edu.^BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance of patients withBarrett's esophagus (BE) to identify those with dysplasia (a precursor ofcarcinoma) or early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) who can be treatedendoscopically. However, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survivaltimes of patients with BE. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis toqualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association ofendoscopic surveillance in patients with BE with survival and other outcomes.METHODS: We searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects ofendoscopic surveillance on mortality and other EAC-related outcomes. We reviewedrandomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patientswith BE who received regular surveillance with those who did not receive regularsurveillance, and studies comparing outcomes of patients withsurveillance-detected EAC vs symptom-detected EACs. We performed a meta-analysisof surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effectsmodel. The primary aim was to examine the association of BE surveillance onEAC-related mortality. Secondary aims were to examine the association of BEsurveillance with all-cause mortality and EAC stage at time of diagnosis.RESULTS: A single case-control study did not show any association betweensurveillance and EAC-related mortality. A meta-analysis of 4 cohort studies foundthat lower EAC-related and all-cause mortality were associated with regularsurveillance (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.71; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI,0.59-0.94). Meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies showed lower EAC-related andall-cause mortality among patients with surveillance-detected EAC vssymptom-detected EAC (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; hazard ratio, 0.59;95% CI, 0.45-0.76). Lead- and length-time bias adjustment substantiallyattenuated/eliminated the observed benefits. Surveillance was associated withdetection of EAC at earlier stages. A randomized trial is underway to evaluatethe effects of endoscopic surveillance on mortality in patients with BE.CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects ofsurveillance in patients with BE, surveillance as currently performed wasassociated with detection of earlier-stage EAC and may provide a small survivalbenefit. However, the effects of confounding biases on these estimates are notfully defined and may completely or partially explain the observed differencesbetween surveyed and unsurveyed patients.^Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Feasibility was assessed by examining the time it took to completethree RS measures, reliability was assessed by examining the variation betweenthree RS measures, and validity was examined by correlation with self-reportedfruit and vegetable consumption. In Study 2, validity was assessed in a smallersample (n 30) by examining associations between RS measures and dietarycarotenoids, fruits and vegetables as calculated from a validated FFQ and plasmacarotenoids.SETTING: Eastern North Carolina, USA.RESULTS: It took on average 94·0 s to complete three RS readings per person. Theaverage variation between three readings for each participant was 6·8 %. In Study2, in models adjusted for age, race and sex, there were statistically significantassociations between RS measures and (i) FFQ-estimated carotenoid intake(P<0·0001); (ii) FFQ-estimated fruit and vegetable consumption (P<0·010); and(iii) plasma carotenoids (P<0·0001).CONCLUSIONS: RS is a potentially improved method to approximate fruit andvegetable consumption among diverse participants. RS is portable and easy to usein field-based public health nutrition settings. More research is needed toinvestigate validity and sensitivity in diverse populations.

The authors completed a literaturesearch using the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL), and Web of Science databases. In total, 71 articles were reviewed.Barriers to accessing pediatric palliative care were categorized according to the4 levels of a modified socioecological model (ie, barriers related topolicy/payment, health systems, organizations, and individuals). Major themesidentified at each level included: 1) the lack of consistent and adequate fundingmechanisms at the policy/payment level, 2) the lack of pediatric palliative careprograms and workforce at the health systems level, 3) difficulties integratingpalliative care into existing pediatric oncology care models at theorganizational level, and 4) the lack of knowledge about pediatric palliativecare, discomfort with talking about death, and cultural differences betweenproviders and patients and their families at the individual level.Recommendations to address each of the barriers identified in the literature areincluded.

Electronic address: hanna_sanoff@med.unc.edu.^OBJECTIVE: A geriatric assessment (GA) assesses functional age of older patientswith cancer and is a well-established tool predictive of toxicity and survival.The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of individualGA items.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 546 patients with cancer ≥ 65 years completed GA from 2009to 2014 and were followed for survival status for a median of 3.7 years. The GAconsisted of function, nutrition, comorbidity, cognition, psychological state,and social activity/support domains. GA items with p < 0.05 in univariableanalyses for overall survival (OS) were entered into multivariable stepwiseselection procedure using a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic scalewas constructed with significant GA items retained in the final model.RESULTS: Median age was 72 years, 49% had breast cancer, and 42% had stage 3-4cancer. Three GA items were significant prognostic factors, independent oftraditional factors (cancer type, stage, age, and Karnofsky Performance Status):(1) "limitation in walking several blocks", (2) "limitation in shopping", and (3)"≥ 5% unintentional weight loss in 6 months". A three-item prognostic scale wasconstructed with these items. In comparison with score 0 (no positive items),hazard ratios for OS were 1.85 for score 1, 2.97 for score 2, and 8.67 for score3. This translated to 2-year estimated survivals of 85%, 67%, 51% and 17% forscores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This three-item scale was a strong independent predictor ofsurvival. If externally validated, this could be a streamlined tool with broaderapplicability.^Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copynumber profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixedsuccesses, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analyticalmethods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriadexperimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics,detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copynumber (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well asnormal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, carefulstatistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somaticASCN changes and single nucleotide variants. Here we describe a flexiblecomputational pipeline, MARATHON, which integrates multiple related statisticalsoftware for copy number profiling and downstream analyses in disease geneticstudies.Availability and implementation: MARATHON is publicly available athttps://github.com/yuchaojiang/MARATHON.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.

We have previously reported that endometriotic lesionsare characterized by global enrichment of H3K27me3. Therefore, we aimed to (1)characterize the expression levels of EZH2 in endometriotic tissues; (2) assessH3K27me3 enrichment in candidate genes promoter regions; and (3) determine ifpharmacological inhibition of EZH2 impacts migration, proliferation, and invasionof endometriotic cells. Immunohistochemistry of an endometriosis-focused tissuemicroarray was used to assess the EZH2 protein levels in tissues. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation-qPCR was conducted to assess enrichment of H3K27me3 incandidate gene promoter regions in tissues. Immunofluorescence was performed toassess the effect of an EZH2-specific pharmacological inhibitor on H3K27me3global enrichment in cell lines. To measure effects of the inhibitor inmigration, proliferation, and invasion in vitro we used Scratch, BrdU, andMatrigel assays, respectively. Endometriotic lesions had significantly higherEZH2α nuclear immunostaining levels compared to eutopic endometrium from patients(glands, stroma) and controls (glands). H3K27me3 was enriched within promoterregions of candidate genes in some but not all of the endometriotic lesions.Inhibition of EZH2 reduced H3K27me3 levels in the endometriotic cellsspecifically, and also reduced migration, proliferation but not invasion ofendometriotic epithelial cells (12Z). These findings support future preclinicalstudies to determine in vivo efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors as promising nonhormonaltreatments for endometriosis, still an incurable gynecological disease.

Side effects of cancer therapy may include subsequent development oferectile dysfunction (ED), hypogonadism, and infertility in adulthood.AIM: The purpose of this review is to focus on the etiology and prevalence of therange of sexual and gonadal dysfunction in adolescent boys and young men who arecancer survivors, while discussing current recommendations for evaluation andtreatment.METHODS: We performed a literature review of articles evaluating hypogonadism,sexual dysfunction, ED, and infertility in young men cancer survivors.OUTCOMES: There is compelling evidence that significant survivorship issues arefaced by boys entering adulthood after completing cancer therapy.RESULTS: Overall, young men cancer survivors are much more likely to reportsymptoms of sexual dysfunction than the general population of men. These patientscan develop ED due to physiologic and psychological changes that take place withdiagnosis of a malignancy and subsequent treatment. Primary hypogonadism canarise due to pelvic radiation or chemotherapy, and central hypogonadism may arisefrom pituitary insufficiency after brain radiation or surgery. Infertilitydevelops from direct damage to the Sertoli cells and germinal epithelium fromradiotherapy or chemotherapy. Cancer survivors who are men should therefore bescreened for these important urological survivorship issues, although exactsurveillance strategies remain unclear.CONCLUSIONS: Urological survivorship issues including ED, hypogonadism, andinfertility are common among cancer survivors and result in significantmorbidity. Due to the medical complexity of cancer survivorship, the populationof adolescent and young adult survivors would benefit from a network ofmultidisciplinary survivorship experts to aid the transition into adulthood.Improved research efforts may help to clarify risk factors and to developenhanced strategies for evaluation and treatment.

Strategies toovercome this primary challenge are largely required.Experimental Design: Wetested the effects of IL12 plus doxorubicin on T-cell penetration and efficacy insolid tumors in a murine lung cancer model, a murine breast carcinoma lungmetastasis model, and two human xenograft tumor models bearing large tumors (>10mm).Results: Intriguingly, this simple approach increased the numbers, thedistribution, and the depth of penetration of infused CD8+ T cells in thesetumors, including both TILs and CAR T cells. This combined treatment halted tumorprogression and significantly extended survival time. Studies of the underlyingmechanism revealed multiple effects. First, the combined treatment maintained thehigh ratios of immune-stimulatory receptors to immune-inhibitory receptors oninfiltrated CD8+ T cells, reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressiveregulatory T cells, and enhanced the numbers of T-bet+ effector T cells in thetumors. Second, doxorubicin induced chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, which mayattract NKG2D+CD8+ T cells to tumors, and this effect was boosted by IL12-inducedIFNγ accumulation in tumors, promoting the penetration of NKG2D+CD8+ Tcells.Conclusions: The deep penetration of infused T cells associated withcombined IL12 plus doxorubicin yielded striking therapeutic effects in murine andhuman xenograft solid tumors. This approach might broaden the application ofT-cell therapy to a wider range of solid tumors.

We sought to characterise the prevalence and correlates of theincorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than currentcigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit.METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 650 adultsmokers in the USA. In 2015-2016, before the VLNC proposal became public, thesesmokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses tocalculate ORs and percentages and a χ2 test to examine the association betweenvariables.RESULTS: Overall, 47.1% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for 30years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. Thismisperception was more common among smokers who were aged above 55 (56.6%) andblack (57.4%). Additionally, 23.9% of smokers reported they would be less likelyto quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes wouldbe less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be lesslikely to quit (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes isless likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely toquit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communicationcampaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due tothe many toxic chemicals in smoke.^© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text ofthe article) 2018.

We aimed to determine whether highintratumor heterogeneity of ER predicts an increased long-term risk (25 years) offatal breast cancer.Methods: The STO-3 trial enrolled 1780 postmenopausal lymph node-negative breastcancer patients randomly assigned to receive adjuvant tamoxifen vs not. Thefraction of cancer cells for each ER intensity level was scored by breast cancerpathologists, and intratumor heterogeneity of ER was calculated using Rao'squadratic entropy and categorized into high and low heterogeneity using apredefined cutoff at the second tertile (67%). Long-term breast cancer-specificsurvival analyses by intra-tumor heterogeneity of ER were performed usingKaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling adjusting forpatient and tumor characteristics.Results: A statistically significant difference in long-term survival by high vslow intratumor heterogeneity of ER was seen for all ER-positive patients (P <.001) and for patients with luminal A subtype tumors (P = .01). In multivariableanalyses, patients with high intratumor heterogeneity of ER had a twofoldincreased long-term risk as compared with patients with low intratumorheterogeneity (ER-positive: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 1.31 to 3.00; luminal A subtype tumors: HR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.18 to 4.99).Conclusions: Patients with high intratumor heterogeneity of ER had an increasedlong-term risk of fatal breast cancer. Interestingly, a similar long-term riskincrease was seen in patients with luminal A subtype tumors. Our findings suggestthat intratumor heterogeneity of ER is an independent long-term prognosticatorwith potential to change clinical management, especially for patients withluminal A tumors.

In addition, we aimed to analyze the relationship betweenregionalization of cancer care and health disparities.METHODS: A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using theNational Inpatient Sample for the period 2000-2014. Adult patients (≥ 18 years ofage) diagnosed with esophageal cancer and who underwent esophagectomy wereincluded. Yearly hospital volume was categorized as low (< 5 procedures),intermediate (5-20 procedures), and high (> 20 procedures). Multivariableanalyses on the potential effect of hospital volume on patient outcomes wereperformed, and the yearly rate of esophagectomies was estimated using Poissonregression.RESULTS: A total of 5235 patients were included. Esophagectomy at low- [oddsratio (OR) 2.17] and intermediate-volume (OR 1.62) hospitals, compared withhigh-volume hospitals, was associated with a significant increase in mortality.The percentage of esophagectomies performed at high-volume centers significantlyincreased during the study period (29.2-68.5%; p < 0.0001). The trend towardshigh-volume hospitals was different among the different US regions: South(7.7-54.3%), West (15.0-67.6%), Midwest (37.3-67.7%), and Northeast (55.8-86.8%)[p < 0.0001]. Overall, the mortality rate of esophagectomy dropped from 10.0 to3.5% (p = 0.006), with non-White race, public insurance, and low household incomepatients also showing a significant reduction in mortality.CONCLUSIONS: A spontaneous centralization for esophageal cancer surgery occurredin the US. This process was associated with a decrease in the mortality rate,without contributing to health disparities.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the association ofperiodontal disease severity with cancer risk in black and white older adults ina cohort study that included a dental examination.Methods: Included were 7466 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk inCommunities study cohort who at visit 4 (1996-1998) reported being edentulous orunderwent the dental examination. Probing depth and gingival recession weremeasured at six sites on all teeth; these measurements were used to defineperiodontal disease severity. Incident cancers (n = 1648) and cancer deaths(n = 547) were ascertained during a median of 14.7 years of follow-up. Allstatistical tests were two-sided.Results: An increased risk of total cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend = .004) was observed for severeperiodontitis (>30% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm) compared with no/mildperiodontitis (<10% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm), adjusting for smokingand other factors. Strong associations were observed for lung cancer (HR = 2.33,95% CI = 1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001), and elevated risks were noted forcolorectal cancer for severe periodontitis, which were significant among neversmokers (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.00 to 4.47). Associations were generally weaker,or not apparent among black participants, except for lung and colorectal cancers,where associations were similar by race. No associations were observed forbreast, prostate, or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk.Conclusions: This study provides additional evidence that cancer risk, especiallyfor lung and colorectal cancer, is elevated in individuals with periodontitis.Additional research is needed to understand cancer site-specific and racialdifferences in findings.

We determinedavailability and use of on-site screening breast MRI services based onwoman-level characteristics, including >20% lifetime absolute risk using theNational Cancer Institute risk assessment tool. Multivariate analyses wereperformed to determine sociodemographic characteristics associated with on-sitescreening MRI use.RESULTS: Overall, 43.9% (2403/5468) of women at high lifetime risk attended afacility with on-site breast MRI screening availability. However, only 6.6%(158/2403) of high-risk women obtained breast MRI screening within a 2-yearwindow of their screening mammogram. Patient factors associated with on-site MRIscreening use included younger (<40 years) age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-4.21), family history (OR = 1.72, 95% CI:1.13-2.63), prior breast biopsy (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.22-3.58), and postsecondaryeducation (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.04-4.74).CONCLUSIONS: While nearly half of women at high lifetime breast cancer riskundergo routine screening mammography at a facility with on-site breast MRIavailability, supplemental breast MRI remains widely underutilized among thosewho may benefit from earlier cancer detection. Future studies should evaluatewhether other enabling factors such as formal risk assessment and patientawareness of high lifetime breast cancer risk can mitigate the underutilizationof supplemental screening breast MRI.

Multivariable logisticregression estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the association of MRI use with breast density and family history,adjusting for woman and tumor characteristics.RESULTS: Overall, preoperative MRI use was 16.4%. The proportion of womenreceiving breast MRI was similar by breast density (17.6% dense, 16.9% nondense)and family history (17.1% with family history, 16.5% without family history).After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no difference in preoperativeMRI use by breast density (OR = 0.95 for dense vs. nondense, 95% CI: 0.73-1.22)or family history (OR = 0.99 for family history vs. none, 95% CI: 0.73-1.32).CONCLUSIONS: Among women aged >65 years with breast cancer, having dense breastsor a first-degree relative with breast cancer was not associated with greaterpreoperative MRI use. This utilization is in keeping with lack of evidence thatMRI has higher yield of malignancy in these subgroups.

The authors review the known literature on seminoma metastatic to theorbit, and describe an additional case in a 33-year-old man.METHODS: A literature search was performed on the MEDLINE database using keywords"seminoma," "testicular germ-cell tumors," "testicular cancer," "testicularneoplasm," "orbital metastasis," and "germ-cell neoplasms."RESULTS: Malignant neoplasms of the testis account for only 1% of cancers in men.None-the-less, testicular germ cell seminoma is the most common solid tumor foundin young men between the ages of 15 and 39. Only seven previous cases have beenmentioned in the literature. The pathogenesis remains unclear although genetic,environmental, and maternal factors may play a role. The number of cases is toofew to determine the best treatment options, but surgical excision and adjunctiveorbital radiotherapy appear to be most appropriate.CONCLUSIONS: Although metastases to the orbit are rare, seminoma should beconsidered in the differential diagnosis of all young men with proptosis.

Confirming this association is importantbecause of the paucity of biomarkers of breast cancer risk in premenopausalwomen. We conducted a consortium study including ten prospective cohorts that hadcollected blood from premenopausal women. A nested case-control design wasimplemented within each cohort. A total of 2,835 invasive (80%) and in situ (20%)breast cancer cases were individually matched to controls (n = 3,122) on age atblood donation. AMH was measured using a high sensitivity enzyme-linkedimmunoabsorbent assay. Conditional logistic regression was applied to theaggregated dataset. There was a statistically significant trend of increasingbreast cancer risk with increasing AMH concentration (ptrend across quartiles<0.0001) after adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. The odds ratio (OR) forbreast cancer in the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH was 1.60 (95%CI = 1.31-1.94). Though the test for interaction was not statisticallysignificant (pinteraction  = 0.15), the trend was statistically significant onlyfor tumors positive for both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor(PR): ER+/PR+: ORQ4-Q1  = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.46-2.64, ptrend <0.0001; ER+/PR-:ORQ4-Q1  = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.40-1.68, ptrend  = 0.51; ER-/PR+: ORQ4-Q1  = 3.23,95% CI = 0.48-21.9, ptrend  = 0.26; ER-/PR-: ORQ4-Q1  = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.63-2.09,ptrend  = 0.60. The association was observed for both pre- (ORQ4-Q1 = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.05-1.73) and post-menopausal (ORQ4-Q1  = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.53) breastcancer (pinteraction  = 0.34). In this large consortium study, we confirmed thatAMH is associated with breast cancer risk, with a 60% increase in risk for womenin the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH.^© 2018 UICC.

Although exercise is cardioprotective, its influence overautophagy-mediated tumor growth and cardiac function are not welldefined.PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise on tumormorphology and cardiac function.METHODS: Fisher 344 rats (n = 28) were assigned to one of four groups: 1)sedentary non-tumor bearing (SED), 2) sedentary tumor bearing (SED + T), 3) wheelrun non-tumor bearing (WR), or 4) wheel run tumor bearing (WR + T). Rats remainedsedentary or exercised for 6 wk. At week 4, rats in tumor groups were inoculatedwith MatBIII tumor cells. At week 6, cardiac function was measured.RESULTS: SED + T animals exhibited significantly lower left ventricular developedpressure when compared with SED, WR, and WR + T (P < 0.05). This coincided with asignificant increase in cardiac autophagy (increased LC3-II) in SED + T animalswhen compared with SED, WR, and WR + T (P < 0.05). Furthermore, SED + T heartsshowed a significant increase in β-myosin heavy chain expression versus nontumorgroups (P < 0.05). Tumor mass was significantly larger (P < 0.001) in SED + Tanimals when compared with WR + T animals, which was accompanied by a significantincrease in tumor LC3-II protein expression (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Nonexercised tumor-bearing rats showed severe cardiac dysfunction andexcessive, maladaptive autophagy in the heart and tumors. Voluntary exercisepreserved cardiac function and attenuated the autophagic response in heart andtumor tissues. This preservation may be related to the reduced tumor growth inaerobically exercised rats, to the improved regulation of autophagy by exercise,or both.

To better understand the patterns of breast reconstruction usage,it is important to identify the clinicopathologic factors associated withimmediate breast reconstruction (IBR), and whether modification of thereconstruction incidence when stratified by patient- or cancer-related factorsexists in the breast cancer population. The primary objectives were to determinewhether the incidence of immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction variesacross age, and whether the tumor grade or radiation therapy modify the effect ofage on the incidence of immediate breast reconstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsdatabase, we identified women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer from2000 to 2014. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted log-binomial regressionwas used to estimate the effect of age on IBR after accounting for potentialconfounding by patient demographic data and cancer characteristics. Potentialeffect measure modification by tumor grade and radiation therapy on the age-IBRrelationship was also assessed.RESULTS: Of 321,206 women, 77,798 (24.2%) had undergone IBR. Age wassignificantly associated with IBR prevalence (P < .0001), with younger women morelikely to undergo IBR. Both tumor grade (P < .0001) and radiation therapy (P <.0001) modified the effect of age on IBR.CONCLUSION: Compared with their older counterparts, younger breast cancerpatients were more likely to undergo IBR, and both tumor grade and radiationtherapy were differentially associated with the likelihood of IBR across patientage.^Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic address: Jch9011@med.cornell.edu.^PURPOSE: The incidence of localized prostate cancer has decreased with shifts inprostate cancer screening. While recent population based studies demonstrated astable incidence of locoregional prostate cancer, they categorized organconfined, extraprostatic and lymph node positive disease together. However, toour knowledge the contemporary incidence of prostate cancer with pelvic lymphnode metastases remains unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)data from 2004 to 2014 to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Weanalyzed trends in the age standardized prostate cancer incidence by stage. Theimpact of disease extent on mortality was assessed by adjusted Cox proportionalhazard analysis.RESULTS: During the study period the annual incidence of nonmetastatic prostatecancer decreased from 5,119.1 to 2,931.9 per million men (IR 0.57, 95% CI0.56-0.58, p <0.01) while the incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases increasedfrom 54.1 to 79.5 per million men (IR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.62, p <0.01). Theincidence of distant metastases in men 75 years old or older reached a nadir in2011 compared to 2004 (IR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90, p <0.01) and it increased in2012 compared to 2011 (IR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, p <0.05). The risk of cancerspecific mortality significantly increased in men diagnosed with pelvic lymphnode metastases (HR 4.5, 95% CI 4.2-4.9, p <0.01) and distant metastases (HR21.9, 95% CI 21.2-22.7, p <0.01) compared to men with nonmetastatic disease.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases is increasingcoincident with a decline in the detection of localized disease. Whether thisportends an increase in the burden of advanced disease or simply reflectsdecreased lead time remains unclear. However, this should be monitored closely asthe increase in N1 disease reflects an increase in incurable prostate cancer atdiagnosis.^Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.Published by Elsevier Inc.

Interviews were conducted with 5,313 Hispanic/Latinoadults as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants were recruited from the study's fourfield centers (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; San Diego, CA) between February2010 and June 2011. Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were assessed withquestions drawn from the Health Interview National Trends Survey. More than halfof the sample endorsed perceived risk of cancer associated with the six evaluatedbehaviors, as well as general perceived efficacy for preventing cancer. Adjustedlogistic regression analyses demonstrated significant differences acrossHispanic/Latino background groups for perceived risk associated with highconsumption of alcohol and saturated fat, low consumption of fruits andvegetables, and insufficient exercise but not with smoking or low consumption offiber. Differences were also found for the belief, "It seems like everythingcauses cancer" but not for other perceived efficacy items. Perceived cancer riskand perceived efficacy for preventing cancer were neither independently norinteractively associated with engagement in cancer-related risk behaviors aftercontrolling for sociodemographic covariates. Results suggest that perceptions ofrisk and efficacy with regard to cancer vary across Hispanic/Latino backgroundgroups, and therefore background group differences should be considered inprevention efforts. Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were not related tocancer-related risk behaviors among Hispanics/Latinos. Further work is needed toevaluate determinants of cancer-related risk in this population.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is positively correlated withcholesterol, potentially increasing PSA-driven biopsy recommendations in men withhigh cholesterol, though biopsy compliance may be lower in men with comorbidconditions. These potential biases may affect PSA-driven biopsy rates andsubsequent prostate cancer detection in men with high serum cholesterol. Ourobjective was to test the association between serum cholesterol and prostatecancer risk in men receiving PSA independent, study-mandated prostate biopsies.METHODS: We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from 4974 non-statin users inREDUCE, a randomized trial in men with elevated PSA and a negative baselinebiopsy. Men underwent 2- and 4-year trial-mandated prostate biopsies.Associations between baseline serum levels of total cholesterol, low-densitylipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prostate cancer risk,overall and by Gleason grade (<7 vs. ≥7), were examined using multivariablelogistic regression.RESULTS: High total serum cholesterol was associated with an increased risk ofhigh-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR per 10 mg/dL 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.09;p = 0.048), but cholesterol was unrelated to either overall or low-grade prostatecancer risk (p-values >0.185). There was no association between serum LDL andoverall, low- or high-grade prostate cancer risk (p-values >0.137). In contrast,elevated serum HDL was associated with increased risk of both overall (OR per10 mg/dL 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16; p = 0.033) and high-grade prostate cancer (ORper 10 mg/dL 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28; p = 0.034).CONCLUSIONS: In REDUCE, where all men received PSA independent, trial-mandatedbiopsies thus ensuring complete prostate cancer ascertainment, high total serumcholesterol and high HDL were associated with increased risk of high-gradeprostate cancer, supporting a cholesterol-prostate cancer link.

It is questionableif patients with BE should be operated to stop GERD and to prevent cancer. Theaim of this study was to determine the role of antireflux surgery in patientswith BE.METHODS: Literature review.RESULTS: The role of antireflux operations is, in fact, very controversial andneglected. BE is a different phenotype of GERD with a distinct pathophysiologylinked to severe reflux of bile and acid, due to a marked anatomic disruption ofthe gastroesophageal barrier. Published series show that a fundoplicationadequately controls GERD and symptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or evenbetter a bile diversion antireflux procedure) may prevent esophagealadenocarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a fundoplication efficiently controls GERD andsymptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or even better a bile diversionprocedure) may also prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Despite more than three decades of intense effort, no effectiveRAS inhibitors have yet to reach the cancer patient. With bitter lessons learnedfrom past failures and with new ideas and strategies, there is renewed hope thatundruggable RAS may finally be conquered. With the KRAS isoform mutated in 84% ofall RAS-mutant cancers, we focus on KRAS. With a near 100% KRAS mutationfrequency, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered the mostRAS-addicted of all cancers.

The approach draws on developments in methods for causal inference.The results offer a different way to quantify radiation's effects and show thatconventional estimates of the population burden of excess cancer at highradiation doses are driven strongly by projecting outside the range of currentdata. Summary results obtained using the proposed approach are similar inmagnitude to those obtained using conventional methods, although estimates ofradiation-related excess cancers differ for many age, sex, and dose groups. Atlow doses relevant to typical exposures, the strength of evidence in data issurprisingly weak.

To most significantly affectpopulation health, these trainings need to reach practitioners who may havelimited access to on-site trainings. Despite the number of organizations offeringtrainings, little is known about how to scale up trainings to efficiently extendtheir reach or how to tailor trainings to the needs of different intervention.The Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network and its collaborating centershave developed a training curriculum and delivered it in both in-person anddistance formats to a range of audiences.

The present phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, andefficacy of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breastcancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received buparlisib once daily (range, 50 to 100mg) for 3 weeks with capecitabine twice daily (range, 1000 to 1250 mg/m2) for 2weeks with a 1-week break. Dose escalation used a traditional "3 + 3" design withstandard definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose.RESULTS: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 23 were evaluable for DLT and 17 wereevaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination wasbuparlisib 100 mg daily and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily. DLTs includedgrade 3 hyperglycemia and grade 3 confusion. The most common grade 3 toxicitieswere diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alaninetransaminase. One patient exhibited a complete response to treatment and four hada confirmed partial response. In cohorts 3 and 4, in which the buparlisib doseremained constant but the capecitabine dose was increased, significant increasesin the buparlisib plasma concentration were noted.CONCLUSION: The combination of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients withmetastatic breast cancer was generally well-tolerated, with several patientsdemonstrating prolonged responses. Unexpectedly low rates of PIK3CA mutations (3of 17) were seen, and only 2 of 7 tumors with subtyping were luminal, makingexploration of these putative predictive markers impossible. Further study of thecombination is not unreasonable, with expanded pharmacokinetics and sequencinganalysis to better elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and more accuratepredictive biomarkers of response.^Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this report, we propose a definition for reducedcoverage regions and describe a set of standards for variant calling in clinicalsequencing applications.METHODS: To enable sequencing centers to assess the regions of poor sequencingquality in their own data, we optimized and used a tool (ExCID) to identifyreduced coverage loci within genes or regions of particular interest. We usedthis framework to examine sequencing data from 500 patients generated in 10projects at sequencing centers in the National Human Genome ResearchInstitute/National Cancer Institute Clinical Sequencing Exploratory ResearchConsortium.RESULTS: This approach identified reduced coverage regions in clinically relevantgenes, including known clinically relevant loci that were uniquely missed atindividual centers, in multiple centers, and in all centers.CONCLUSION: This report provides a process road map for clinical sequencingcenters looking to perform similar analyses on their data.

By early 2017, 43 states andWashington, DC, had passed laws to ensure patients with private insuranceenrolled in fully insured health plans pay no more for anticancer medicationsadministered by mouth than anticancer medications administered by infusion.Federal legislation regarding this issue is currently pending. Despite theirrapid acceptance, the changes associated with state adoption of oral chemotherapyparity laws have not been described.Objective: To estimate changes in oral anticancer medication use, out-of-pocketspending, and health plan spending associated with oral chemotherapy parity lawadoption.Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of administrative health plan claimsdata from 2008-2012 for 3 large nationwide insurers aggregated by the Health CareCost Institute. Data analysis was first completed in 2015 and updated in 2017.The study population included 63 780 adults living in 1 of 16 states that passedparity laws during the study period and who received anticancer drug treatmentfor which orally administered treatment options were available. Study analysisused a difference-in-differences approach.Exposures: Time period before and after adoption of state parity laws,controlling for whether the patient was enrolled in a plan subject to parity(fully insured) or not (self-funded, exempt via the Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act).Main Outcomes and Measures: Oral anticancer medication use, out-of-pocketspending, and total health care spending.Results: Of the 63 780 adults aged 18 through 64 years, 51.4% participated infully insured plans and 48.6% in self-funded plans (57.2% were women; 76.8% wereaged 45 to 64 years). The use of oral anticancer medication treatment as aproportion of all anticancer treatment increased from 18% to 22% (adjusteddifference-in-differences risk ratio [aDDRR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.13; P = .34)comparing months before vs after parity. In plans subject to parity laws, theproportion of prescription fills for orally administered therapy withoutcopayment increased from 15.0% to 53.0%, more than double the increase(12.3%-18.0%) in plans not subject to parity (P < .001). The proportion ofpatients with out-of-pocket spending of more than $100 per month increased from8.4% to 11.1% compared with a slight decline from 12.0% to 11.7% in plans notsubject to parity (P = .004). In plans subject to parity laws, estimated monthlyout-of-pocket spending decreased by $19.44 at the 25th percentile, by $32.13 atthe 50th percentile, and by $10.83 at the 75th percentile but increased at the90th ($37.19) and 95th ($143.25) percentiles after parity (all P < .001,controlling for changes in plans not subject to parity). Parity laws did notincrease 6-month total spending for users of any anticancer therapy or for usersof oral anticancer therapy alone.Conclusions and Relevance: While oral chemotherapy parity laws modestly improvedfinancial protection for many patients without increasing total health carespending, these laws alone may be insufficient to ensure that patients areprotected from high out-of-pocket medication costs.

In April of 2015, Kentuckynative Tawny Willoughby (TW) shared a graphic skin cancer selfie on Facebook thatsubsequently went viral. We examined the volume of comments and shares of heroriginal Facebook post; news volume of skin cancer from Google News; and searchvolume for skin cancer Google queries. We compared these latter metrics after TWsannouncement against expected volumes based on forecasts of historical trends.TWs skin cancer story was picked up by the media on May 11, 2015 after the socialmedia post had been shared approximately 50,000 times. All search queries forskin cancer increased 162% (95% CI 102 to 320) and 155% (95% CI 107 to 353) onMay 13th and 14th, when news about TW's skin cancer selfie was at its peak, andremained higher through May 17th. Google searches about skin cancer preventionand tanning were also significantly higher than expected volumes. In practicalterms, searches reached near-record levels - i.e., May 13th, 14th and 15th wererespectively the 6th, 8th, and 40th most searched days for skin cancer sinceJanuary 1, 2004 when Google began tracking searches. We conclude that an ordinaryperson's social media post caught the public's imagination and led to significantincreases in public engagement with skin cancer prevention. Digital surveillancemethods can rapidly detect these events in near real time, allowing public healthpractitioners to engage and potentially elevate positive effects.^Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we quantified breast cancerresistance protein (BCRP/Bcrp) and MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein expressionin RBCs from humans, monkeys, dogs, rats and mice using nanoLC/MS/MS, andevaluated their effect on RBC partitioning and plasma exposure of theirsubstrates. BCRP-specific substrate Cpd-1 and MDR1-specific substrate Cpd-2 werecharacterized using Caco-2 Transwell® system and then administered to Bcrp orP-gp knockout mice. 3. The quantification revealed BCRP/Bcrp but not MDR1/P-gp tobe highly expressed on RBC membranes. The knockout mouse study indicatedBCRP/Bcrp pumps the substrate out of RBCs, lowering its partitioning and thuspreventing binding to intracellular targets. This result was supported by a Cpd-1and Bcrp inhibitor ML753286 drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in mice. Because ofenhanced partitioning of Cpd-1 into RBCs after BCRP/Bcrp inhibition, Cpd-1 plasmaconcentration changed much less extent with genetic or chemical knockout of Bcrpalbeit marked blood concentration increase, suggesting less DDI effect. 4. Thisfinding is fundamentally meaningful to RBC partitioning, pharmacokinetics and DDIstudies of BCRP-specific substrates.

Sheps Center for Health Services Research, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.(4)4 University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC,USA.^Introduction The rising cost of cancer drugs may make treatment unaffordable forsome patients. Patients often rely on drug manufacturer-administeredPharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) to obtain drugs and reduced or no cost.The overall usage of PAPs within cancer care delivery is unknown. Methods Weincluded all cancer patients across an academically affiliated, integrated healthsystem in North Carolina during 2014 ( N = 8591). We identified the subset ofpatients receiving PAP assistance to afford one or more cancer drugs, in order tocalculate the proportion of patients receiving PAP assistance, and the retailvalue of the assistance. Results Among 8591 cancer patients, 215 unique patientssubmitted a total of 478 successful PAP requests for cancer drugs. 40% ofPAP-utilizing patients were uninsured, 23% had Medicaid coverage, 20% hadMedicare coverage, 2% were dual Medicare/Medicaid eligible, and 14% werecommercially insured. Among all cancer patients who received medical treatment,6.0% required PAP assistance, whereas 10.6% receiving an oral agent required PAPassistance. The proportion receiving PAP assistance varied substantially by drug,ranging from <1% of patients (e.g. carboplatin, methotrexate) to 50% of patients(e.g. ponatinib, temsirolimus). The majority of the retail value obtained was fororal agents, including $1,556,575 of imatinib and $1,449,633 of dasatinib, whichwere the two drugs with the highest aggregate retail value. Conclusions Asubstantial proportion of cancer patients receive private charitable assistanceto obtain standard-of-care treatments. This includes patients with federal andprivate insurance, suggesting an inability of patients to meet cost-sharingrequirements.

Twelve HLS (32.16 ± 8.06) and 36 CON (32.42 ± 7.64) were enrolledin the study. Fatigue was assessed using the 20-item Multidimensional FatigueInventory, muscle strength using an isokinetic dynamometer, body compositionusing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and thickness and muscle quality usingB-mode ultrasound. Differences between HLS and CON were analyzed usingindependent samples t tests. No significant differences were observed betweengroups for any demographic characteristics: age ( P = .922), weight ( P = .943),height ( P = .511), body mass index ( P = .796), fat mass ( P = .688), fat-freemass ( P = .520), and percent body fat ( P = .446). No significant differenceswere observed for strength (peak torque; P = .552), relative peak torque ( P =.200), muscle thickness ( P > .05) and muscle quality ( P > .05). However,self-perceived fatigue was significantly higher in HLS than in CON ( P = .009).It appears that when HLS are matched by age and physical activity levels to CON,no significant difference in body composition, muscle thickness, muscle quality,or strength is observed. Self-perceived fatigue, as predicted, is higher in HLS,which may have implications and should be considered when prescribing exercisetraining to this cancer population.

Our study sought to identify whichconstituent disclosure message elements are most effective in discouraging peoplefrom smoking.Methods: Three hundred eighty eight current smokers aged 18 and older completedan online survey in February 2015. We randomized participants to respond to oneof two sets of 13 toxic products that contain cigarette constituents and 25health effects associated with cigarette constituents.Results: Products that elicited the most discouragement were those with lowerchances of exposure (e.g., explosives), followed by products with possibleexposure (e.g., rat poison), and products with a high likelihood of exposure(e.g., floor cleaner). Awareness of toxic products that constituents are found in(p < .001) and low exposure products (p < .001) were associated with higherdiscouragement. Health effects that people had heard are caused by cigarettesmoke constituents elicited higher discouragement from smoking cigarettes (p <.001). Cancer was associated with higher discouragement relative to respiratory,cardiovascular, and reproductive health effects (all p < .001).Conclusions: Cigarette smoke constituent messages may be more effective atdiscouraging smoking if they include information about carcinogenic healtheffects (e.g., mouth cancer and lung tumors) and low exposure toxic products(e.g., explosives and radioactive material) as message elements.Implications: Our study identified health effects and toxic products, especiallycancers and rarely encountered toxic products, that may discourage smoking whenincluded in disclosure messages. By constructing messages that communicate theharms associated with tobacco use by contextualizing those harms in terms ofspecific constituents, tobacco education messaging efforts may be increasinglysuccessful.

In this concurrent prospective andretrospective study, we assessed oral chemotherapy adherence in patientsreceiving their prescriptions at an institutional specialty pharmacy, with anintegrated oral chemotherapy program. The primary endpoint is medicationpossession ratio. Secondary endpoints include self-reported adherence comparingsurvey data before and after the introduction of the oral chemotherapy program toassess the impact of the comprehensive pharmacy services provided. Patientsreceiving their oral chemotherapy from the institutional specialty pharmacy havea mean medication possession ratio of 0.92, indicating excellent adherence rates.The oncology clinical pharmacist, in collaboration with the specialty pharmacy,has also decreased the rates of patient-reported non-adherence.

However, unlike the RASfamily, where gain-of-function missense mutations are found in ∼25% of all humancancers, missense mutations are relatively rare in RHO proteins. Instead, alteredRHO activity in cancer more commonly arises through the aberrant functions of RHOGTPase regulators. In many cancer types, altered expression and/or mutation ofRHO-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RHOGEFs) or GTPase-activatingproteins (RHOGAPs), which activate or inactivate RHO GTPases, respectively, isobserved. For example, deletion or loss of expression of the RHOA GAP DLC1 iswell-established to drive cancer growth. Recently, we identified high expressionof 2 RHOGAPs, ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1, in the basal-like breast cancer subtype.Unexpectedly, both of these RHOA GAPs exhibited properties of oncoproteins ratherthan tumor suppressors, in contrast to DLC1. In this commentary, we summarize ourfindings and speculate that different RHOA GAPs can play distinct roles in cancerdepending on their spatial regulation and cancer type context. We also evaluateour results in light of recently-described cancer genome sequencing studies thathave identified loss-of-function mutations of RHOA in specific cancer types.
